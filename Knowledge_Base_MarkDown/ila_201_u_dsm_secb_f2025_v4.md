## Ch. 1: GAAP Objectives and Their Implications to Insurers

## Overview of This Reading

Note: Section B. 1 of the course is quite lengthy because we've chosen to keep all the GAAP book chapters together in sequence. The GAAP book is arguably the single largest source due to the breadth of GAAP accounting topics covered in the on-syllabus chapters. Don't be discouraged if it takes a while to complete B.1. Other sections of the course will progress more quickly!

The first chapter of the book introduces fundamental concepts and philosophies that underpin US GAAP accounting

Many of the concepts and terms in this chapter will be covered in significantly more detail in later chapters, so don't worry too much about understanding everything you see in this chapter on the first pass

## Key topics for the exam include:

- Stock vs. mutual companies
- Basic financial statement concepts
- Cash vs. accrual accounting
- Users of financial statements
- Oversight roles in GAAP accounting
- FASB and other standard setters
- Importance of relevant and reliable financial statements
- Relationship between the balance sheet and income statement
- Dual entry accounting
- Criteria for recognition and measurement
- Materiality standard
- Key disclosures


## Fundamental Concepts

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are the conventions, rules, and procedures that define accepted US accounting practices

- Stock vs. mutual companies
- To operate, insurers need capital, which is raised from stockholders (for stock companies) and policyholders (for mutual companies)
- 2 primary types of companies owned by stockholders:

## Page 5
1. Publicly traded - issue shares of stock that are traded on exchanges
2. Privately held - not traded on an exchange

- Stockholders expect to earn a return based on the riskiness of their investment
- Policyholders of mutual companies expect coverage at a reasonable price
- GAAP reporting provides transparency to stockholders, policyholders, and related parties
- Financial statements are the primary sources of GAAP information
- Provide summarized information about an enterprise's assets, liabilities, and how transactions affect earnings
- Expressed in units of a single, uniform currency unadjusted for inflation
* Non-monetary information is converted to monetary (e.g. value of equipment)
- Measures a single entity, not the entire industry
* Subsidiaries are consolidated into a single set of financial statements
- Reportable segments are based on operating segments
* Operating segment $=$ relatively homogenous segment of a company as viewed by the company's decision-makers
* May be different company to company
- Information is not intended to be the sole determinant of company value
- Information includes transactions that have already taken place (e.g. premium payments) and estimates of future amounts using actuarial methods (i.e. reserves)
- Measured over a clearly defined period (quarterly or annually)
* Many users want to see performance over shorter periods-challenging for life insurance, which is very long-term in nature
- Cash vs. accrual accounting
- 2 basic types of transactions impact financial statements: cash events and accruals
- Cash basis accounting is the simplest: record accounting entries only when cash changes hands
* Not appropriate for incomplete or long-term transactions (like life insurance)
- Accrual accounting alters the timing of when cash transactions are recognized
* Involves making accrual adjustments to cash transactions so that revenues and expenses are allocated more evenly over the measurement period
* Reserves and DAC are examples
- General purpose vs. specialized purpose financial reporting

## Page 6
- ASOP 8: Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting:
- States that the "general purpose" GAAP financial reporting is intended to inform decision-making for investors, lenders, and creditors
- May also be helpful to policyholders
- Specialized purposes include statutory filings and federal income tax reporting
- Information sources other than financial statements:
- Conference calls with analysts
- Responses to queries from rule-makers
- Supplementary information provided to investors
- Press releases
- Users of financial statements
- Capital providers (debt and equity)
- Financial institutions
- Investment banks
- Private lenders
- Commercial banks
- Individual investors
- Brokers and dealers in financial instruments issued by the enterprise
- Expert advisors to users of financial statements
- Attorneys, actuaries, and accountants
- Policyholders or any other stakeholder in the enterprise
- Oversight roles
- Management responsibilities:
- Fair presentation of the company's financial position in accordance with GAAP
- Completion of the financial reporting process
- Provide explanations of matters that may not be evident in numerical information
- Auditors: can opine on the fairness of the presentation and effectiveness of internal controls
- Independent external auditors
- Not employees: hired by and report to Board

## Page 7
- Opinions are based on testing and $\mathrm{COSO}^{1}$ criteria
* Internal auditors
- Can be employees of the company or contracted third parties
- Other regulatory bodies with oversight roles:
* SEC - oversees public companies
* IRS - tax authority
* Domicile state insurance department
- Other users acting on behalf of others: stock analysts and rating agencies
- FASB and other rule-makers / standard-setters
- Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
* Establishes uniform standards for the contents of financial statements: Accounting Standards Codification (ASC)
* Issues Statements of Financial Accounting Concepts (SFACs)
- These are not in the ASC but help define GAAP objectives
- E.g. SFAC No. 8 clarifies that financial reports are based on estimates/models, not exact "depictions"
* Benefits all parties by standardizing information provided and avoiding numerous individual requests for specific information
- AICPA and PCAOB: issue standards for accountants and auditors
* AICPA: American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
* PCAOB: Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
- SEC: ultimate regulator of US public companies
* Can de-list or halt trading of a company's stock
* Issues various pronouncements: manuals, staff bulletins, and enforcement releases
- Financial statement information must be relevant and reliable
- Relevant information must be timely
* Perfect information is not valuable if provided too late
* Must balance timeliness and accuracy
- To be relevant, the information must be consistent and comparable
* Consistent $=$ based on similar or identical measures used in prior periods

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{1} \mathrm{COSO}=$ Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission

## Page 8
- Comparable $=$ equivalent to measures used in other enterprises
- Should also be comparable across different time periods
- Prior results should be restated when errors surface
- Should ideally be independent of the form of the enterprise ${ }^{2}$
- Some standards are entity-specific (e.g. ASC 944 applies only to insurers)
- Information is relevant if it provides appropriate detail
- Adequate detail informs the user without being confusing/difficult to use
- Reliable information must be materially accurate and verifiable
- Information should be accurate within a margin of tolerance that would not impact a user's view or lead to incorrect decisions
- Justice Thurgood Marshall defined materiality in a 1976 SCOTUS decision:
"(a)n omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important [in their decisionmaking]"
- Reliability also implies "free of bias"
- Biased information (e.g. overstated/understated asset values) would lead to incorrect decisions


# - Other accounting bases relevant to insurers 

- US statutory accounting: NAIC SAP principles differ from GAAP in significant ways
- GAAP is designed to meet the needs of the different users of financial statements
- Stresses earnings measurement and revenue/expense matching
- Recognizes assets that may be non-admitted or not exist under stat (e.g. deferred acquisition costs)
- SAP is designed to address the concerns of regulators (solvency, policyholder protection)
- Stresses measurement of ability to pay claims
- Establishes more conservative reserves
- IFRS 17 is relevant to insurers outside the US
- IFRS 17 is insurance contract-based, not entity-based like GAAP

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ For example, GAAP attempts to make the same rules for certain deposit contracts offered by both banks and insurers.

# Basic Elements of Financial Statements 

Specific financial statements include:

- Balance sheet
- Income statement
- Statement of comprehensive income
- Statement of stockholders' equity
- Statement of cash flows

The authors only discuss the first 3 in this chapter in the sections that follow

## Double-Entry System

GAAP accounting entries are based on the double-entry system ${ }^{3}$, which involves tracking debits and credits

- Debit - an increase in an asset
- Credit - an increase in a liability or equity

The authors provide only a limited explanation for credits and debits as shown above. This concept will come up again shortly in the chapter, and we also have examples in the video lesson to help clarify.

## Balance Sheet

The balance sheet has 3 main sections ("elements"): assets, liabilities, and equity

- Assets $=$ Liabilities + Equity
- Equity $=$ capital consisting of:
- Paid-in stock equity
- Additional paid-in capital
- Retained earnings


## SFAC No. 8 defines the balance sheet elements:

- Asset $=$ present right of an entity to an economic benefit
- "Present right" also allows the entity to restrict others' access to the asset
- Provisions for losses may be required if the probable future economic benefit declines
- Can be tangible (financial instruments, property, etc.) or intangible (goodwill, patents, etc.)
- Reinsurance creates a recoverable asset for the ceding company

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ The authors also use the phrase "dual-entry" in places, but they are referring to the same thing.

## Page 10
* Should reflect the credit risk of the reinsurer
- Liability $=$ present obligation of an entity to transfer an economic benefit
- ASC 450 requires liabilities for contingent events that are probable and can be reasonably estimated
- Equity (aka "net assets") = residual interest in the entity's assets after deducting liabilities
- Increases when additional capital is paid in and/or positive earnings are retained
- Decreases if losses occur and/or dividends are paid out


# Income Statement 

Comprehensive income $=$ net income + other comprehensive income (OCI)

- Comprehensive income $=$ all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from owner investments or distributions
- Net income $=$ Revenues - Expenses
- Revenue $=$ Premiums + Fees + InvInc
- Expenses $=$ Benefits + Expenses
- Expenses include not only cash outflows but also decreases in accounting assets (e.g. DAC) and increases in liabilities (e.g. policy reserves)
- Realized gains and losses are also included in revenue and expenses, respectively
- Other comprehensive income (OCI) = changes in equity arising from gains and losses that "are not a central part of the company's operations"
- "Gains" and "losses" refer to changes in equity other than retained earnings and other than owner contributions/distributions
- Examples of items recorded in OCI: ${ }^{4}$
* Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale (AFS) assets
* Shadow adjustments for certain liabilities backed by AFS assets
* Impact of discount rate revisions for traditional long-duration insurance
* Changes in the fair value of market risk benefits (MRBs) attributable to own credit risk

EOY Equity = BOY Equity + Comprehensive Income + Owner Transactions

- Owner Transactions $=$ Capital Contributions - Dividends

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ These concepts will be developed and defined in much more detail in later chapters.

## Page 11
# Recognition and Measurement of Financial Statement Elements 

Recognition - recording of an item using the appropriate treatment at the appropriate time
SFAC No. 5 criteria for recognition and measurement:

- Definition: asset, liability, revenue, or expense
- Measurability: must have an attribute that is quantifiable with sufficient reliability
- Examples of attributes:
* Historical cost: easy to determine using company records but may need to be adjusted for depreciation
* Fair value: may be obtained from active secondary markets or expert appraisals
* Present value: based on cash flows discounted at a rate that can vary (more subjective and less preferable than the other 2, but required for the vast majority of life insurance reserves)
- Measured in uniform monetary units unadjusted for inflation
- Relevance: consistent, comparable, and meaningful in users' decision-making
- Reliability: accurate, verifiable, and free of bias
"Hidden reserves" used by management to cushion losses are inappropriate under GAAP


## Financial Statement Accounts and Inter-Relationships

Accrual adjustments are made to cash transactions so that earnings emerge in proportion to the "completeness" of the earnings process

- Premium-related liabilities defer recognition of premium revenue until premiums are earned
- Unpaid claim liabilities provide for benefits already incurred but not yet settled
- A liability for future policy benefits (LFPB) provides for future claims not yet incurred
- DAC defers acquisition costs so that they are recognized more evenly over the contract term

Short-duration unearned premium reserve (UPR) example:

- Suppose the insurer collects 100 in premium on a 1-year A\&H contract at BOY
- The insurer will establish an initial UPR of 75 , where $75=$ unearned portion of the premium collected at BOY
- Q2 UPR $=50$, Q3 UPR $=25$, Q4 UPR $=0$
- Q1 net income $=100$ in premium collected -75 increase in UPR $=25$
- Q2 net income $=0$ in premium collected $-(-25)$ increase in UPR $=25$, etc.

## Page 12
Dual entry accounting for Q1:

| Description | Account Type | Debit | Credit |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | --: |
| Policyholder pays premium | Revenue |  | 100 |
| Increase cash asset using premium | Asset | 100 |  |
| Incur accounting expense for $\uparrow$ in UPR | Expense | 100 |  |
| Establish UPR on BS | Liability |  | 100 |
| Recognize revenue by releasing earned portion of UPR | Revenue |  | 25 |
| Reduce UPR on BS by earned amount | Liability | 25 |  |
|  | Total | 225 | 225 |

Dual entry (aka double entry) accounting is often hard to understand for anyone that hasn't taken accounting courses or studied accounting history. It dates back to the 14th century, and the main idea is to track the flow of money or "economic benefit" from sources (credits) to destinations or uses (debits). In other words, it assumes money cannot be created-it can only be transferred from one place to another. Balancing debits and credits allowed ancient accountants to verify the accuracy of their ledgers.

The key to "getting it" is to force your brain to ignore the usual definition/connotation of the words "debit" and "credit." Specifically, don't view those words as "subtractions" and "additions." Credits include liabilities and revenue, while debits include assets and expenses.

This chapter provides some fairly detailed examples of double-entry accounting involving a range of ILA products. We've included another example and commentary in the video lesson to help explain what's going on, and we will revisit some of the UL and VUL examples later in the course after we've covered important concepts in those accounting models in later chapters. I don't think the double-entry accounting examples for those products will make much sense until you get through Ch. 7.

For long-duration contracts, recognition of premiums is different for traditional vs. nontraditional contracts

- For traditional products (WL, term), premiums are recognized as revenue when paid
- For UL and deferred annuities, premiums are never recognized as revenue
- Revenue consists of COI charges and fees collected

We will cover the full accounting models for all long-duration contracts in later chapters

# Measurement Methods, Estimates, and Materiality 

Even though PVs are the least preferable means of measuring financial statement items, PVs are necessary for ILA products, which have uncertain future cash flows

Key tradeoff: "It is better to have approximately correct information on a timely basis than more accurate information too late to be valuable"

Estimates should be precise enough to allow for informed decisions

- Some users of financial statements may require more precision than others
- Immaterial imprecision does not need to be corrected, but material errors should be

## Page 13
- "Immaterial" means the impact will not influence decision making
- Requires judgment to determine


# Other Revenue Streams 

Insurers may have revenue sources beyond insurance contracts:

- Non-insurance services offered to customers (investment, claims management)
- Accounted for under ASC 606
- Broker-dealer transaction fees charged for asset trades made on clients' behalf


## Disclosures

- Footnotes and narrative disclosures supplement the primary financial statements
- E.g. the insurer may need to describe some future liability that can't be quantified currently
- SEC Regulation S-K - describes the impact of market risk exposure on financial statements
- Quantitative disclosure $=1$ of 3 alternatives:
* Tabular information on market risk-sensitive instruments
* Sensitivity analysis on future earnings under selected hypothetical scenarios
* VaR of future earnings based on changes in interest rates, exchange rates, etc.
- Qualitative information listing the exposures, how they have changed, and how they are managed
- Disclosures for changes in accounting principles
- ASC 250 deals with accounting changes and error corrections
- ASC 855 deals with significant events that occurred after the end of the reporting period but before the release of financial statements
- Additional disclosures included in GAAP financial statements:
- Description of the company and its products
- Summary of significant accounting policies
- Details of invested assets
- Details of various reserves and accounting assets
- Sale or purchase transactions during the year
- Nature of reinsurance
- Stockholder dividends, stock repurchases, or other capital transactions

## Ch. 3: Product Classification

## Overview of This Reading

This chapter describes how to classify insurance contracts vs. other types of contracts and gives an overview of the measurement models under ASC 944, which is the primary GAAP standard for insurance entities

The material in the first part of the chapter (contract classification) is probably more important than the material in the second part (measurement models) because all of the measurement models you need to know for the exam are covered in much, much more detail in later chapters.

## Key topics for the exam include:

- How ASC 944 applies to insurance entities
- How to classify contracts as insurance, investment, or non-financial goods/services
- Get a brief introduction to relevant measurement models
- Short- vs. long-duration
- Traditional contracts
- Non-traditional contracts
- Participating contracts
- Market risk benefits and other embedded derivatives


## ASC 944 Contract Classification

ASC Topic 944, Financial Services - Insurance ("ASC 944") is the primary source of guidance for insurance entities:

- Stock and mutual life insurers
- P\&C insurers
- Captive insurers
- Reinsurers
- Fraternal benefit societies

ASC 944 applies only to insurance entities
Insurance contracts issued by non-insurance entities (e.g. a manufacturer's warranty) are accounted for under a different standard

Contracts issued by insurance entities are classified as either short- or long-duration

## Page 16
- Short-duration contracts have a single measurement model
- Long-duration contracts have multiple models based on the type of insurance contract
- Reinsurance contracts are also classified as either short- or long-duration

ASC 944's accounting models prescribe liabilities that address unique aspects of insurance

- Liabilities for future claims that effectively defer recognition of premium revenue until insurance services are provided
- Liabilities for insured events that have already occurred (claim liabilities)

1. Future contingent payments on claims that have been adjudicated and are being paid (disabled life reserves)
2. Claims in course of settlement (ICOS) - claims not yet paid (fully adjudicated or not)
3. Claims incurred but not reported (IBNR)
4. Claim settlement expenses

ASC 944 also provides guidance for investment contracts issued by insurers

- Accounted for similarly to other interest-bearing financial instruments

UL and VA contracts may also have additional features like market risk benefits and embedded derivatives that require additional accounting models

# Overview of Contract Classification 

Contracts should be assessed individually (not in groups) and only at issue
Contracts should first be assessed to determine if they are an insurance contract
To be classified as an insurance contract, the contract must transfer other-than-nominal insurance risk

- Insurance risk = underwriting risk + timing risk
- Excludes investment risk
- "Fortuitous": insured has no control over occurrence of adverse events
- Underwriting risk: uncertainty in ultimate amount of net contract cash flows
- Timing risk: uncertainty in timing of net contract cash flows

If the contract's insurance risk is not nominal, classify it as an insurance contract

- "Nominal" means insignificant or has only a remote chance of occurring (requires judgment)
- Common examples of insurance risk: death, disability, endowment maturities
- It is possible for a contract to be classified as insurance under GAAP but not other accounting standards (IFRS, statutory, etc.)

## Page 17
If the contract has no insurance risk or only nominal insurance risk, determine whether it is an investment contract, service contract, or something else

# Significance of Insurance Risk in Life and Health Contracts 

Most products sold as "life insurance" or "health insurance" in the US transfer significant insurance risk (no testing required)

- WL, term, and most health premiums are relatively small compared to the benefits payable UL contracts with higher PHABs may require additional analysis:
- Determine a significance ratio

$$
\frac{\text { PV(Excess Payments) }}{\text { PV(Assessments) }}
$$

- Excess payments = benefit payments in excess of the policyholder account balance (PHAB)
- Assessments = amounts assessed to the contract including investment margins
- Investment margin $=($ Net Inv Rate - Credited Rate $) \times$ PHAB

There is no specific threshold for the significance ratio (judgment required), but the higher the ratio, the more significant the mortality/morbidity risk

- I.e. if the ratio is too low, it's not insurance

A UL contract with a very high PHAB relative to the DB would be more likely to fail the significance ratio test

- For example, a single premium UL (SPUL) policy would have a very high initial PHAB, which would generate large investment margins for the life of the contract
- The authors show an example of a SPUL contract with a 4\% significance ratio, which they say is too low (not enough insurance risk to be classified as an insurance contract). There is no specific cutoff, however, so it's ultimately a judgment call.

Most modern UL contracts will have a sufficiently high significance ratio

- Since the 1980s, tax law has required UL DBs to be sufficiently larger than PHABs to receive favorable tax status ${ }^{5}$

The significance ratio framework can be applied to other forms of insurance when there is any doubt

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{5}$ Life insurance taxation is covered in much more detail later in the course. A single premium UL policy would most likely not qualify as life insurance for tax purposes, so it would be a very uncommon product. Tax law also requires the DB to ratchet up if the policyholder pays in a lot of premium. Therefore tax law indirectly limits the investment margin in the numerator of the significance ratio described in this chapter.

## Page 18
# Significance of Insurance Risk in Annuity Contracts 

Life-contingent immediate (payout) annuities are classified as life insurance
Immediate annuities can pay life-contingent benefits, non-life-contingent benefits, or both (aka "certain and life")

Those that combine life- and non-life-contingent payments are still considered insurance contracts unless:

- Probability of life-contingent payments is remote
- PV of life-contingent payments is insignificant relative to all payments

The investment component does not need to be separated unless it is distinct from the rest of the contract

There is no prescribed approach for assessing the remoteness of life-contingent payments
The authors suggest looking at the following ratio over a range of scenarios:

$$
\frac{\text { PV(Life-Contingent Payments) }}{\text { PV(Total Payments) }}
$$

As long as this ratio exceeds $5 \%$ to $10 \%$, the annuity should be classified as an insurance contract The ratio will be lower for:

- Older issue ages
- Longer certain periods

For example, a 30-year certain and life annuity issued to a 65-year-old would have a very low probability of LC payments (i.e. would be considered an investment contract)

Annuities that pay additional insurance benefits that vary with capital markets volatility may also be classified as insurance contracts

A guaranteed annuitization option on a deferred annuity does not itself result in insurance contract classification

- If/when annuitization occurs, it generates a new contract (an immediate annuity), which can then be evaluated


## Identifying Other Components of Insurance and Investment Contracts

For UL-type and investment contracts, additional accounting models may apply:

## 1. ASC 944 market risk benefits (MRBs)

- Most common example: GMxBs on VAs
- $\mathrm{MRB}=$ contract or contract feature that both provides protection to the policyholder from capital market risk and exposes the insurer to other-than-nominal capital market risk

## Page 19
- Other-than-nominal means that it varies significantly with capital market volatility
- Accounted for at FV and shown separately from other items in financial statements
- Change in FV goes through income except for the portion attributable to a change in the insurer's own credit risk, which is reported in OCI
- Criteria for evaluating whether a contract/feature is a MRB:
- "Protection" means the insurer is exposed to capital market losses when the AV < benefit offered (aka a "shortfall" in account balance)
* This risk has been passed from contractholder to insurer
- DB protection provided by a life insurance contract is not a MRB
- "Nominal risk" - risk amount is insignificant or has a remote probability of occurring
- Much more detail on MRBs in Ch. 11


# 2. ASC 815 embedded derivatives 

- A contract is a derivative if all 3 ASC 815 criteria are met:
(a) Contains an underlying and one or more notional amounts or payment provisions
(b) Does not require an initial net investment to enter the contract
(c) Contract terms permit/require net settlement or allow for delivery of an asset of similar value
- Not in scope of ASC 815:
- Any contract/feature classified as an MRB under ASC 944 (do the MRB assessment first)
- Any contract/feature that pays a benefit based on an insured event (falls under ASC 944)
- Some insurance contracts have embedded derivatives that can be separated from the host contract (e.g. IUL or indexed annuities)
- Account for the embedded derivative under ASC 815 and the host under ASC 944


## ASC 606: Revenue recognition for non-financial goods or services

- Applies to a contract/feature that isn't an insurance or investment contract under ASC 944
- The insurer should first evaluate the entire contract under ASC 944
- If a service provided with an insurance/investment contract could be sold on a standalone basis, it should be bifurcated

## Page 20
- AAG-REV provides examples of services provided by insurers that should be bifurcated: ${ }^{6}$
- Claims adjudication and processing (for claims above or below a deductible)
- Health insurance activities related to fulfillment of the contract
- Safety inspection performed for P\&C contracts
- Roadside assistance (auto policies)
- Cybersecurity activities (general liability policies)
- Title search (title insurance)
- Other possible examples: fee-for-service arrangements, asset management, insurance brokering, pension administration, and claims administration
- In some cases, contracts may need to be combined for accounting purposes
- E.g. if an insurer may offer a services-only contract at the same time it offers an insurance contract to the same customer ${ }^{7}$
- The contracts should be evaluated for interdependencies and combined if they are interrelated (account for under ASC 944)
- If a service component is bifurcated, the insurer must allocate revenue between the service and insurance components
- ASC 606 provides a 5-step process:

1. Identify the contract with a customer
2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract
3. Determine the transaction price
4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
5. Recognize revenue as the entity satisfies a performance obligation

- The allocation is usually based on the price of the service assuming it was sold on a standalone basis (requires judgment)


# Measurement Models 

Subsequent chapters on the syllabus go into great detail on all of the long-duration models summarized in this section. We are only mentioning very high-level points, and we recommend just skimming over this material. Once you complete all of the GAAP book chapters, you will have seen all of these models in great

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{6}$ None of these relate to life insurance. The book uses "AAG-REV" to abbreviate "The AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide - Revenue Recognition."
    7 This might be the case for a reinsurer that offers admin services and a stop-loss reinsurance agreement to the same ceding company.

## Page 21
detail, and this will be more of a review on your next pass(es) over the syllabus. This chapter also largely omits discussion of DAC, which is a major "measurement" topic that will be covered in Ch. 4.

Once a contract has been classified as either an insurance or investment contract under ASC 944, it will follow one or more of the measurement models listed below

Contracts should first be classified as either short- or long-duration
Short-duration contracts have only one measurement model, while long-duration measurement models vary by type of product and also with the features on those products

# Assessment of Contract Duration 

## Short-duration contracts:

- Provide insurance protection for a fixed period of short duration (usually $\leq 1$ year)
- Allow the insurer to cancel the contract or adjust provisions (e.g. premiums) at the end of any contract period


## Long-duration contracts:

- Generally not subject to unilateral changes in provisions
- Requires the insurer to perform various functions/services for an extended period

Most P\&C and health contracts are short-duration (e.g. home, auto, warranties)

- True even if coverage/pricing is guaranteed for more than 1 year because of the nature of the relationship

Life insurers rarely write short-duration individual policies

- Examples: certain kinds of ART life contracts, credit life, and disability

Large group life contracts are usually considered short-duration if frequently negotiated and priced on a short-term basis

Individual A\&H can be short- or long-duration, but are generally long-duration, especially if noncancellable or guaranteed renewable

- Noncancelable - insurer is not allowed to cancel the policy or increase premiums for any reason
- Guaranteed renewable - insurer cannot unilaterally cancel the policy, but the premium rates may be increased subject to certain conditions (e.g. regulatory approval or adverse experience)
- Re-rating must be by class, not individual contract

Classifying ART insurance and YRT reinsurance as short- vs. long-duration requires judgment

- The more frequent the pricing/underwriting, the more likely it will be short-duration

## Page 22
- YRT reinsurance on long-duration life insurance is generally considered long-duration as well $^{8}$
- Contracts with larger first-year commissions are expected to stay inforce longer

Examples of products that fall under the long-duration guidance in ASC 944:

- Term life
- WL
- LTCI
- UL (fixed and variable)
- Deferred annuities (fixed and variable)
- Payout annuities

UL and deferred annuities may also have MRBs and embedded derivatives that require additional measurement models

# Short-Duration Measurement Model 

Unlike long-duration contract types, there is only one short-duration measurement model under ASC 944

- Recognize premiums as revenue over the coverage period in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided
- Liability = gross unearned premium reserve where the premium is earned ratably over the premium period
- Usually done on a straight-line basis: e.g. if an annual premium is paid BOY, the liability at $\mathrm{Q} 1=75 \%$ of annual premium
- Establish claim liabilities for ICOS, IBNR, etc. using current estimates of future claims payments


## Long-Duration Measurement Models

There are 3 potential models for the basic contract:

1. Traditional and limited-payment contracts
2. UL-type and non-traditional contracts
3. Certain participating life insurance contracts
[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{8}$ I would assume YRT reinsurance on any normal ILA product (term, WL, UL, deferred annuity, etc.) is long-duration unless an exam problem provides details to the contrary.

## Page 23
These models will be covered in great detail in future chapters. The remaining portion of this chapter provides a summary of each, and we are "summarizing" their summary at a very high level to just provide a quick snapshot of each measurement model. This material will feel like a very high-level review after you've gone through all of the GAAP book chapters at least once, so don't spend too much time trying to "learn" these models on your first pass through this introductory chapter.

# Traditional and Limited-Payment Contracts 

Key contract characteristics: contract terms are fixed and guaranteed

- Examples: term, WL, and LTCI

For all traditional long-duration life insurance:

- Liability for future policyholder benefits (LFPB) uses a net premium ratio approach
- Update liability assumptions at least annually using current estimates
- Measure LFPB at both the original and current discount rate (an upper-medium grade yield)
- Establish claim liabilities for pending, resisted, and IBNR

Limited-payment contracts: also establish a deferred profit liability (DPL)

- Defers the GP in excess of NP used in the benefit liability
- Amortize against insurance inforce (or benefit payments for annuities)

This measurement model will be covered in detail in Ch. 5.

## UL-Type and Non-Traditional Contracts

Key contract characteristics: contract terms are NOT fixed and guaranteed

- Examples: UL and deferred annuities (fixed and variable forms of each)

Liability $=$ sum of:

1. Policyholder account balance (most significant)
2. Additional liability for excess benefits or profits followed by losses

- Based on a benefit ratio approach using current estimates

3. Sales inducement liabilities and assets (SILs and SIAs)

- Examples of sales inducements: immediate bonuses, persistency bonuses, or enhanced crediting rates

4. Unearned revenue liability (URL)

- Relevant when front-end loads or level COI are present

5. Premium deficiency liability

## Page 24
- Required when testing shows that the PV of gross premium is not sufficient to cover the PV of future benefits as well as recover PVP (aka VOBA)

Many investment contracts follow the same guidance ${ }^{9}$
This measurement model will be covered in detail in Ch. 7 and 11.

# Certain Participating Life Insurance Contracts 

Many par WL policies issued by mutual companies and certain stock companies follow the contribution principle and have their own ASC 944 measurement model ${ }^{10}$

Par policies that follow the contribution principle have all of the following characteristics:

- Long-duration contracts expected to pay policyholder dividends based on the insurer's actual experience
- Annual policyholder dividends are paid in a manner that both
- Identifies divisible surplus
- Distributes surplus according to the contribution principle (i.e. distributes surplus in approximately the same proportion as the contracts' contribution to surplus)

The total liability under the model for these policies is the sum of 3 items:

1. NLP reserve for death and endowment benefits

- Similar to the LFPB but using locked-in assumptions and a different discount rate

2. Terminal dividend liability
3. Liability for loss recognition (premium deficiency)
4. Policyholder dividend obligation for closed blocks resulting from demutualizations

## Other Items

Claim liabilities like ICOS, IBNR, etc. require judgment, and there aren't approaches prescribed by GAAP

- Established separately from the liability for policy benefits for short-duration and UL, but may be combined with the LFPB for traditional contracts

Riders can be measured with the base contract if they are not separable; otherwise measure separately

Ch. 5 has more detail on claim liabilities and rider accounting.

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{9}$ For example, a basic fixed deferred annuity is essentially a UL contract without COI charges or death benefit. It has all of the other fund value mechanics, however.
    ${ }^{10}$ This model is covered in detail in Ch. 6, which is NOT on the syllabus.

## Page 25
# Investment Contracts 

Investment contracts do not meet the criteria for insurance contracts
ASC 944 guidance says to treat investment contracts similarly to interest-bearing or other financial instruments

1. Non-account value investment contracts: e.g. non-life contingent payout annuities

- Follow the "interest method"
- Liability $=\mathrm{PV}$ of benefits using an effective yield that equates actual deposits and expected future deposits with the actual payments and expected future payments on the contract over its lifetime

2. Account value investment contracts

- Follow deposit accounting (similar to bank deposits, loans, etc.)
- Liability $=$ account value

Reinsurance agreements that do not transfer sufficient insurance risk also follow deposit accounting

- Example: A surplus relief contract

This measurement model will be covered in detail in Ch. 12.

## Ch. 4: Expenses

## Overview of This Reading

Under GAAP, expenses are generally recognized when cash is disbursed or liabilities are accrued
This chapter covers accounting for "expenses," which refers to any cost or expense other than benefits paid to policyholders

In other words, this chapter is mostly about how to account for acquisition costs, maintenance expenses, etc.

## Key topics for the exam include:

- 6 expense types under GAAP
- Criteria for deferring acquisition costs
- Examples of deferrable and nondeferrable acquisition costs
- How to defer and amortize deferrable acquisition costs (DAC)
- Treatment of nondeferrable expenses


## Some Terminology Notes

The authors note that the term "cost" can be used interchangeably with "expense." They generally use the word "cost" in this chapter to refer to any non-benefit outflow from the insurer.

The word "expensed" is also important to understand in a GAAP context. While some costs/expenses are expensed as incurred, others are deferred and expensed in the future through mechanisms like DAC. The word "expensed" basically means "recognized," as in when an expense/cost is recognized in income. For example, while acquisition costs are mostly incurred at issue, they are expensed over the life of the contract by way of DAC amortization.

## ASC 944 Categorization of Expenses

Some costs must be recognized when incurred, while others are capitalized (deferred) and amortized

| Expense Type | GAAP Ramification |
| :-- | :-- |
| 1. Deferrable acquisition | Capitalize and amortize (through DAC) |
| 2. Nondeferrable acquisition | Expense as incurred |
| 3. Direct maintenance | Expense as incurred |
| 4. Investment expenses | Expense as incurred |
| 5. Overhead (indirect expenses) | Expense as incurred |
| 6. Claim settlement / loss adjustment | Include in benefit/claims reserves |

## Page 27
# Deferrable Acquisition Costs 

Acquisition costs are associated with the sale of insurance and investment contracts
Acquisition costs eligible for deferral are capitalized into a DAC asset, which amortizes over the life of the contracts

- Other names for DAC include unamortized acquisition costs (UAC), deferred policy acquisition costs (DPAC), and unamortized expense assets (UEA)
- DAC is an asset held on the GAAP balance sheet, and changes in GAAP go through GAAP income

Only acquisition costs directly related to the successful acquisition of new/renewal contracts (aka "successful efforts") can be deferred:

1. Incremental direct acquisition costs
2. Any employee compensation not included in (1) that is an incremental direct cost of acquisition:
(a) Underwriting
(b) Policy issuance/processing
(c) Medical and inspection
(d) Salesforce (time/resources spent selling products)
3. Other costs directly related to items under (2) that would not have occurred if the contract wasn't acquired

Determining whether a given expense meets the criteria above often requires judgment

- Different companies may arrive at different judgments, but that's fine as long as each company is consistent in its method and documents it

Any costs/expenses that do not meet the deferrability criteria are expensed as incurred on the income statement

## Examples of Deferrable Acquisition Costs

1. Commissions (most common deferrable expense)

- Includes commissions paid to agents and brokers
- Typically directly related to acquisition and successful sales
- Short-duration contracts: defer entire commission
- Long-duration: defer the excess over ultimate commissions
- Based on the commission rate, not commission in dollars
- Flexible-premium UL: target premium is the most common premium base used
* Less common: use projected ultimate premium

## Page 28
- Special cases:
- LP contracts: defer all premium-based commissions (ultimate amount = zero)
- Contracts where a declining commission rate and increasing premium pattern result in roughly level commissions: no commissions are deferrable
- Agent financing costs - e.g. commissions paid in advance or other types of loans
- Usually not included in DAC
- These are capitalized into a different receivable asset
- Commission vesting schedules usually result in declining commission schedules
- Can result in lower ultimate commission rates
- Fund-based commissions - paid as a \% of fund value on UL and deferred annuities
- Not deferrable if the rate does not directly vary with new business or is not related to a successful acquisition
- Level rate would never be deferrable
- Non-level rate could result in deferrable amounts, but practice varies and care should be taken


# 2. Expenses Similar to Commissions 

- Generally deferrable if connected to successful sales
- Examples: volume bonuses, sales contests, cost to attend sales conventions, etc.
- Other situations requiring judgment:
- Renewal incentives based on target renewal levels
- Overrides paid to general agents
* Must be directly related to successful sales
* GA's role must also be directly related and essential to the sales effort ${ }^{11}$
- "Salary-plus-bonus" compensation for sales supervisors
* Must isolate the portion directly related to successful sales
* Compensation for agent training/recruitment is not deferrable
- Agency expense allowances/reimbursements
* Must be analyzed carefully to exclude portion related to administration, rent, depreciation, equipment costs, and overhead
- Salary compensation paid to sales forces
* Deferrable portion is based on the amount directly related to successful sales

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{11}$ GAs manage other agents, so the question is often about how much of the GA's compensation is for general management vs. how much the individual was actually involved directly in the sale.

## Page 29
* Must allocate fixed salaries based on activity, time, etc. spent on successful direct sales

3. Home Office Expenses

- General marketing and advertising costs: generally not deferrable since they aren't directly related to successful sales
- Examples: magazine ads or costs to attract salespeople
- Direct-response advertising costs: are deferrable if 2 conditions are met:
(a) Primary purpose was to elicit sales to customers who responded specifically to the advertising
(b) Direct-response ads result in probable future benefits
- Requires evidence based on historical results from the company's prior ad campaigns
- Must demonstrate that revenues resulting from the ads exceed the advertising costs
- Industry statistics alone are not sufficient (must be company-specific)
- Underwriting expenses: deferrable if related to successful sales
- Includes any kind of compensation (salaries, benefits, etc.) for the underwriters involved in direct, successful sales
* Also includes their support staff (admin assistants, etc.)
- Amounts related to agent supervision are nondeferrable overhead
- Policy issue expenses: generally deferrable and involve the same considerations as underwriting expenses
- Includes policy form assembly, mailing, etc.
- Policy issue support functions: usually requires allocation to identify the deferrable portion
- Includes creation of commission statements, policy illustrations, etc.


# Nondeferrable Acquisition Costs 

An insurer will likely incur expenses necessary to sell insurance that doesn't meet the deferrability criteria in ASC 944

Nondeferrable acquisition costs - any acquisition cost associated with new and renewal business that doesn't meet ASC 944's deferrability criteria

Examples of expenses incurred to acquire new business that aren't deferrable:

- Creation of new/updated rate books
- Dividend and reserve factor development

## Page 30
- Advertising that promotes the insurer in general
- Salespeople recruiting and training allowances
- Any underwriting or other cost for a policy that isn't successfully sold ${ }^{12}$

Any expense that doesn't meet the deferrability criteria is expensed as incurred

# Direct Maintenance Costs 

Maintenance costs - costs associated with maintaining insurance contract records, premium collection, and paying commissions

The authors use the term "direct maintenance costs" to distinguish them from overhead
These are always expensed as incurred (never deferrable)

## Investment Expenses

Includes payments to advisors, investment staff, and transaction costs that aren't capitalized into the cost of the asset purchased

These are always expensed as incurred (never deferrable)

## Claim (Loss) Adjustment Expense

Claim or loss adjustment expenses (LAE) are nonlevel costs incurred when a contract terminates or a claim is paid (claims settlement costs)

LAE estimates are included with estimates of benefits in the LFPB

- Insurer can choose to lock in the assumption at issue or update periodically with other LFPB assumptions
- Choice must be made on an entity-wide basis

When a policy enters a claim status, include LAE in the reserve for incurred claims

- Short-duration: always update the LAE assumption each measurement period
- Long-duration: include LAE assumption in IBNR reserves but do not update assumption unless insurer chose not to lock it in

If unlocking (updating) LAE applies, it's broken into 2 buckets:

1. Allocated LAE (ALAE) - directly associated with a known claim (e.g. legal fees)

- Can't be reliably estimated until the claim is incurred

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{12}$ Some percentage of life insurance applicants will ultimately decide not to purchase a policy. For example, someone may go through underwriting only to find out the premium will be higher than expected because they didn't qualify for the risk class they thought they would. The insurer still has to cover the costs of the underwriting and everything else related to the sales effort even though it was unsuccessful.

## Page 31
2. Unallocated LAE (ULAE) - not directly associated with a specific claim (e.g. claim adjusters, overhead)

- Easier to estimate in advance

Even if LAE are locked in, the estimates should be replaced with actuals as they are incurred when recalculating the net premium ratio in the LFPB

- This concept will be much clearer after you get through Ch. 5


# Overhead (Indirect Costs) 

Always expense as incurred

## Other Issues Related to Acquisition Costs

At this point in the chapter, the authors circle back to deferrable acquisition costs and focus on how to account for those.

- Timing of deferrability should correlate with when costs were incurred/recorded
- Deferrable commissions and other costs should not be added to DAC until the costs are incurred
- True-up = adjustment to correct DAC so that it's consistent with actual recorded expenses ${ }^{13}$
- Main point: amounts capitalized in DAC should match the actual deferrable cost recorded
- Requires a reconciliation to identify any inconsistencies and a true-up to correct
- Commissions on unpaid premiums: capitalize as though the premium were paid
- The insurer establishes an asset for due and unpaid premium and a liability for the associated commissions ${ }^{14}$
- Some insurers approximate it as:

Change in Premium Due Liability $\times$ Average Deferral $\%$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{13}$ This is the first of two ways the authors use the term "true-up" in this chapter. Here, they are referring to an adjustment made to DAC so that it's consistent with actual capitalized expenses. Later, the authors use the term "true-up" to refer to an experience adjustment made to DAC when terminations are higher-than-expected. We just wanted to point this out since the same term is being used in two different contexts.
    ${ }^{14}$ These assets and liabilities are released once the premium and associated commission are paid. By establishing an asset and liability for these amounts, the current period income effect is the same as if the premium was paid on time-hence DAC operates the same as if the premium and commission had occurred on schedule.

## Page 32
- Recoverability and loss recognition ${ }^{15}$
- Does not apply to DAC in any way


# Definition of DAC Amortization Basis 

## Short-Duration Contracts

Amortization follows the premium and coverage period
The general approach is to release DAC ratably over the coverage period in proportion to the recognition of premiums

There is not a specific formula prescribed for this, but the authors illustrate a recommended approach that we also demonstrate numerically in the video lesson, which can be expressed in formula form as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{DAC}_{t} & =\text { DeferrableCosts } \times \frac{\text { Unearned Premium }}{\text { Total Premium }} \\
\mathrm{DAC} \text { Amort }_{t} & =\mathrm{DAC}_{t-1}-\mathrm{DAC}_{t}
\end{aligned}
$$

The main idea is that the DAC balance will always be based on the percentage of remaining unearned premium. Simple example: suppose you capitalize 1000 at the beginning of the year, and premiums are paid annually at BOY. The initial DAC will be 1000, followed by 750 at EOQ 1, 500 at EOQ 2, etc. DAC amortization is simply the change in DAC balance between reporting dates. If premiums change during the year, DAC must be trued up, and we illustrate that in the video lesson as well.

## Investment Contracts

For DAC purposes, investment contracts are contracts with no significant mortality/morbidity risk or surrender charges

- I.e. substantially all revenue comes from investment spreads
- Examples: GICs, period-certain annuities, etc.

DAC amortization follows the "interest method" (aka effective yield method)
For a period-certain single premium immediate annuity:

1. Solve for an $\operatorname{IRR}\left(r_{\text {gross }}\right)$ such that the PV of benefits at issue equals the gross premium received

- $\operatorname{GrossLiab}_{t}=\mathrm{PV}_{t}($ Future Ben $)$ using $r_{\text {gross }}$

2. Solve for second $\operatorname{IRR}\left(r_{\text {net }}\right)$ such that the PV of benefits at issue equals the gross premium received minus deferrable acquisition costs

- NetLiability ${ }_{t}=\mathrm{PV}_{t}($ Ben $)$ using $r_{\text {net }}$

3. Implied $\mathrm{DAC}_{t}=\operatorname{GrossLiab}_{t}-\operatorname{NetLiability}_{t}$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{15}$ This concept is only relevant to UL-type business and will be covered in more detail in Ch. 7. Before ASU 2018-12 took effect, DAC was subject to loss recognition, so the authors of this chapter probably just wanted to make it clear that's not the case anymore.

## Page 33
$r_{\text {gross }}$ and $r_{\text {net }}$ are simply IRR measures where $r_{\text {gross }}<r_{\text {net }}$. Even though this chapter demonstrates how to carry out this calculation, we will hold off until Ch. 12 to demonstrate it in our course lesson since this method is relevant only to investment contracts that essentially derive all revenue from interest margins (e.g. period-certain payout annuities).

The vast majority of insurance and annuity products covered on the syllabus will follow the approach described next.

# Long-Duration Contracts 

This approach is applicable for all long-duration insurance contracts (term, WL, UL, etc.) as well as any deferred annuity with surrender charges or any investment contract with significant sources of revenue other than investment margins or asset-based fees

Even though the approach described here is the most important DAC approach to know for the exam since it applies to most products, it is very difficult to understand in words alone. You'll want to rely more on the video lesson's numerical examples to grasp what's happening here.

DAC must be amortized on a constant-level basis over the contract's expected term

- Individual contracts: amortize DAC on a straight-line basis
- If calculating DAC for groups (cohorts) of contracts: approximate straight-line amortization using a basis such as the projected amount of insurance inforce
- Other bases like policy count may be more appropriate if there is no stated face amount (will be covered later in product-specific chapters)
- The grouped approach will not exactly replicate the individual contract approach
* If DAC is tracked at the contract level, it will be written off if a contract terminates for any reason
* The grouped approach is designed to allocate DAC amortization according to the distribution of future inforce ${ }^{16}$
- Groups should be the same as those used for the LFPB
- There is no requirement to perform any quantitative materiality analysis to justify the approximation
- Key requirement: any amortization basis used must be independent of profit emergence ${ }^{17}$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{16}$ This is much easier to understand through example, so be sure to check out the video lesson for that.
    ${ }^{17}$ This requirement makes more sense if you are familiar with the history of GAAP before ASU 201812 created the current DAC approach found in ASC 944. Before ASU 2018-12, DAC amortization approaches varied by product and always involved interest discounting revenue streams like premiums or profit margin streams on UL products. Today, DAC is disconnected entirely from premium revenue, interest rates, and other profit margin elements.

## Page 34
- Few companies use the individual contract approach since it results in faster amortization of DAC due to the "double-decrement" paradox ${ }^{18}$

DAC should be amortized over the expected term of the contract

- "Expected term of the contract" is widely interpreted to refer to the expected future lifetime of the contract
- The contract term is not static or locked-in
- Contract term includes the claim payment period, but not the period following annuitization
- For example, the accounting contract term for a deferred annuity would end if/when the contractholder annuitizes the balance, turning the contract into a payout annuity. Same idea for any kind of GLB that converts the contract into a different type if the benefit is elected (or when $F V=0$ for GMWBs).
- Includes the claims settlement period for LTC and disability contracts


# Recognize actual termination experience immediately in income 

- Individual basis: Write off DAC immediately for terminating contracts (death or lapse)
- Grouped basis: true-up DAC amortization to reflect higher-than-expected terminations in the current period
- No adjustment is made if terminations are less-than-expected

Alternative grouped method: reflect current period experience in the beginning-of-period DAC

- This approach avoids the need to make a true-up adjustment or any additional DAC writedowns since it waits until the current period's experience is known

While either approach is allowed, the first grouped approach generally seems like the default approach in most GAAP literature, including multiple chapters of this book. We demonstrate both approaches in the video lesson.

## Long-Duration DAC Formulas

As with short-duration contracts, there is no specific formula codified anywhere for long-duration DAC, but the following formulas represent the most foolproof framework for any situation, including when assumptions change for future experience:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { AmortRatio }_{t} & =\frac{\left(\text { DAC }_{t-1}+\text { Capitalization }_{t}\right)}{\sum_{t}^{n} \text { BOYIF }_{t}} \\
\text { DACAmort }_{t} & =\text { AmortRatio }_{t} \times \text { BOYIF }_{t} \\
\text { DAC }_{t} & =\text { DAC }_{t-1}+\text { Capitalization }_{t}-\text { DACAmort }_{t}
\end{aligned}
$$

where

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{18}$ This term coined by the authors is unique to this book and is easier to illustrate through example in the video lesson.

## Page 35
- Capitalization $_{t}=$ deferrable expenses incurred and capitalized in year $t$
- $\mathrm{BOYIF}_{t}=\mathrm{BOY}$ inforce for year $t$ (can be expressed as face amount inforce, units inforce, etc.)
- AmortRatio $_{t}=$ current DAC plus any new capitalizations as a level percentage of the sum of future inforce
- This causes DAC amortization to emerge as a level $\%$ of BOY inforce
- This percentage will change when new capitalizations occur and when assumptions for future projected inforce change

If terminations are higher-than-expected (which would cause the actual BOY inforce to be lower-than-expected), calculate a true-up ${ }^{19}$ (aka experience adjustment) to DAC amortization:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{TrueUp}_{t} & =\frac{\text { OrigBOYIF }_{t}-\text { ActualBOYIF }_{t}}{\text { OrigBOYIF }_{t}} \times \text { OrigDAC }_{t} \\
\mathrm{DAC}_{t} & =\mathrm{DAC}_{t-1}+\text { Capitalization }_{t}-\mathrm{DAC} \text { Amort }_{t}-\text { TrueUp }_{t}
\end{aligned}
$$

The true-up adjustment reflects the additional DAC written off for terminations in the period This is a one-time adjustment and does not have any effect on the amortization ratio unless the insurer also changes assumptions for future inforce

As noted earlier, the only want to fully understand these methods is to work through examples in the video lessons.

# Sales Inducements 

In this section of the chapter, the authors shift gears away from DAC (and expenses in general) to talk about sales inducements, which are relevant to fund value products like UL and deferred annuities. Sales inducements include bonus interest paid to entice people to purchase UL and annuity products as well as persistency bonuses intended to lower lapse rates.

Some of the accounting mechanics for sales inducements are borrowed from DAC, so on one hand it makes sense to cover sales inducements here. However, since the amounts capitalized in sales inducement assets and liabilities have nothing to do with the types of expenses covered earlier in this chapter and since they are relevant to UL and deferred annuities, we will hold off on getting into the details until later in the course. You can find this portion of Ch. 4 covered in Ch. 7 on p. 65 of the detailed study manual.

## Special DAC Issues

In this final section, the authors return to the topic of expenses to mention a few additional details.

## - Internal replacements ${ }^{20}$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{19}$ The authors use the term "true-up" in a different context here than before. The purpose of the true-up adjustment here is to "course correct" the DAC balance if terminations are higher-than-expected.
    ${ }^{20}$ This chapter does not define "internal replacement" because a later chapter of the book (not on syllabus) goes into much more detail about the topic. An internal replacement is a modification in product

## Page 36
- Any unamortized DAC should be released if a contract is substantially changed (treat as a termination)
- Any expense incurred to establish the new contract can be capitalized into a new DAC balance if the expenses meet deferrability criteria


# - Reinsurance 

- Any amounts paid by the reinsurer to reimburse the ceding company for acquisition costs should be used to reduce the ceding company's DAC
* If the reimbursements from the reinsurer exceed the ceding company's actual acquisition costs, reduce DAC to zero then establish a liability to offset the remaining amount paid by the reinsurer
- If the ceding company agrees to service the underlying policies "without reasonable compensation" from the reinsurer, the ceding company accrues a liability for the estimated servicing costs

GAAP reinsurance accounting will be covered in more detail later in the GAAP section of the course.

## Disclosures for DAC and Related Balances

Companies are required to disclose certain information for DAC and related balances (e.g. sales inducements)

- Nature of the costs deferred
- Inputs, judgments, assumptions, and methods used
- Also disclose changes since prior disclosure
- Disaggregated tabular rollforward of DAC and SIs (beginning to the ending balance)
benefits, features, etc. that occurs in specific situations (e.g. a policyholder exchanges their policy for a new one, modifies the policy, etc.). There are very specific rules (not included in the testable chapters) that govern whether a policy is "substantially changed" for GAAP accounting purposes. If a contract is substantially changed, balances like DAC are written off and reestablished under the new contract.

## Ch. 5: Nonparticipating Traditional Life Insurance

## Overview of This Reading

This chapter covers nonparticipating traditional life insurance (mostly term and WL) and also includes dividend-paying policies that don't follow the contribution principle ${ }^{21}$

The accounting model for nonpar life insurance was heavily impacted by ASU 2018-12, which lead to the current standards for nonpar traditional life codified in ASC $944^{22}$

Note that we aren't necessarily covering every section of this chapter in the same order they appear in the book. Instead, we're following an order that we believe is more conducive to learning the key foundational concepts first and also trying to group similar concepts in a more logical order than the chapter.

## Key topics for the exam include:

- ASC 944 classification of traditional long-duration contracts
- Unit of account
- Liability for future policy benefits (LFPB)
- Measurement at issue
- Subsequent measurement
- Cash flow assumption requirements and considerations
- NPR unlocking and remeasurement gains/losses
- Discount rate assumption and OCI effects
- Approaches for the locked-in discount rate
- Deferred profit liability
- Claim liabilities and premium accruals
- Rider considerations
- UPPEA for restricted dividends
- Profit emergence formulas
- Disclose requirements

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{21}$ Most participating (dividend-paying) business issued by mutual insurers follows the contribution principle and is subject to a related but different accounting model under ASC 944-20-15-3 covered in Ch. 6 (not on syllabus).
    ${ }^{22}$ Insurers adopted the new standards at various points after the year 2018. Before ASU 2018-12, the business in this chapter followed the legacy FAS 60 approach, but that's become more of a historical footnote at this point.

## Page 38
# Product Classification and Features 

## Short-duration contracts:

- Provide insurance protection for a fixed period of short duration
- Allow the insurer to cancel the contract or adjust provisions (e.g. premiums) at the end of any contract period

This chapter is devoted to long-duration traditional life insurance:

- Generally not subject to unilateral changes in provisions
- Requires the insurer to perform various functions/services for an extended period

To be classified as traditional long-duration, a contract must have fixed and guaranteed terms, but other features can vary:

- Benefit period length
- Face amount pattern: level, increasing, or decreasing
- Premium payment period can be the same as the coverage period or limited-pay


## Common nonpar traditional long-duration contracts:

- Whole life - provide a DB for life
- Premiums can be single premium, 10 or 20 years, to age 65, or life
- Usually offer nonforfeiture values (CSV, RPU, ETI)
- May pay dividends, which may or may not follow the contribution principle
- Endowments - WL that pays a benefit if the insured survives the coverage period
- Maturity benefit usually equals face amount
- Some may pay smaller endowments at various points during coverage (called "coupons")
- Term life - provide for coverage over a specified time period
- Premiums are usually coterminous with coverage period (e.g. 10 years)
- Usually do not offer nonforfeiture values
- Premiums can be level, increasing, or level then ART

Dividend-paying policies that meet both of the criteria below are outside the scope of this chapter

1. Dividends are determined in accordance with the contribution principle
2. Issued by one of the following entities:

- A mutual insurer

## Page 39
- Stock insurer that resulted from a demutualization
- Stock insurer that explicitly elects to use the methodology discussed in Chapter 6

Dividend-paying policies not meeting the above criteria are in scope of this chapter and also meet the "fixed and guaranteed terms" criteria because the insurer's ability to change premiums is fixed and guaranteed even if the premiums themselves are not

# Unit of Account 

ASC 944 provides little guidance on the level of aggregation for the liability for future policy benefits (LFPB)

While seriatim reserves are technically possible, it would make it difficult to unlock the net premium ratio (NPR), which is required by ASC 944

- If reserves are seriatim and a contract terminates, there is no way to reflect that in the NPR since the contract is no longer inforce
- Therefore, some level of grouping is necessary

ASC 944 states that contracts within a group must be in the same cohort (issued within 1 year of each other)

- Commonly, this means each group is composed of contracts from the same issue year

Contracts in a given group should also be fairly similar with regard to:

- Type (e.g. don't mix term and WL)
- Contract length
- Premium paying period
- Mixing LP with non-LP business can distort the deferred profit liability (DPL) ${ }^{23}$
- Rating class
- Issue age (possibly a range)
- Face amount band

Creating smaller groups can allow more precise assumptions relative to experience, but there are drawbacks:

- Credibility becomes more of a challenge
- There will be more groups in total, increasing the chance that some may have to show an immediate loss in income ${ }^{24}$
${ }^{23}$ DPL mechanics are covered later in the chapter. The purpose of the DPL is to defer excess gross premium on LP contracts, so if you mix in non-LP business (or even mix LP business with very different payment periods), it would distort the deferral amount at the group level.
${ }^{24}$ This refers to the $100 \%$ cap on the NPR, which is explained in the next section. If there are fewer (larger) groups, there is less chance of hitting the cap because policies with larger profit margins (loads) will offset those with smaller profit margins.

# Liability for Policy Benefits (LFPB) 

Terminology note: the LFPB is ASC 944's formal name for the entire GAAP reserve. It technically includes all reserve components, including claims reserves. The reserve for future benefits is often informally called the "benefit reserve." For traditional non-par business, the benefit reserve is by far the most significant component of the LFPB since claims reserves tend to be small by comparison. As such, we will generally use "LFPB" to refer to the reserve for future benefits/claims that have not yet been incurred.

The LFPB for traditional long-duration contracts (term, WL) is based on a net level premium approach, where reserve premiums $=$ constant $\%$ of gross premium

$$
\mathrm{LFPB}_{t}=\mathrm{PVFB}_{t}-\mathrm{NPR}_{t} \times \mathrm{PVGP}_{t}
$$

Net premium ratio (NPR) $=\%$ of actual and expected GPs required to provide for all benefits and claims-related expenses over the lifetime of the policy ${ }^{25}$

$$
\mathrm{NPR}_{t}=\frac{\mathrm{PV}_{0}(\text { Actual Benefits Through } t)+\mathrm{PV}_{0}(\text { Expected Benefits After } t)}{\mathrm{PV}_{0}(\text { Actual GPs Through } t)+\mathrm{PV}_{0}(\text { Expected GPs After } t)}
$$

The LFPB can never be negative at the group level chosen (i.e. floored at zero)
The NPR is capped at $100 \%$

- This means that there are no separate premium deficiency reserves required for traditional long-duration contracts ${ }^{26}$
- Recoverability testing for the value of business acquired (VOBA) or PV of future profits (PVP) is still required ${ }^{27}$

At least once per year, the NPR must be recalculated as of the issue date (i.e. retrospectively from $t=0$ ) after replacing expected benefits with actual benefits up through the valuation date

- Always use at-inception discount rates (called the interest accretion rates) for all PVs in the NPR calculation
- Estimates of claims-related expenses (LAE) like termination costs, settlement costs, etc. do not have to be updated if the insurer chose to lock them in ${ }^{28}$
- Whenever the NPR is updated to reflect actual cash flows, the actuary must also revise or reconfirm all cash flow assumptions

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{25}$ Don't confuse this "NPR" with the NPR acronym used in a PBR context. If you are in a PBR context, "NPR" represents the net premium reserve component of the VM-20 minimum reserve. If you are in a GAAP context, "NPR" refers to the net premium ratio in the LFPB. The GAAP NPR is analogous to the "NP\%" or "valuation net premium ratio" term we worked with under PBR.
    ${ }^{26}$ Capping the NPR at $100 \%$ basically means you are not allowed to assume more future premium than the GP actually paid by the policyholder.
    ${ }^{27}$ VOBA or PVP arise after a merger or business acquisition. These assets are covered in a different chapter of the book that is not on the syllabus.
    ${ }^{28}$ These are the same LAE discussed in Ch. 4.

## Page 41
Actual and expected benefits only include policyholder benefits (DBs, CSV, maturities, etc.) and LAE

- Use current best estimate assumptions for cash flow assumptions: mortality, lapse, and morbidity (if applicable)
- Excludes acquisition, maintenance, overhead, and investment expenses, which must be expensed when incurred ${ }^{29}$

Cash flow and assumptions should be reviewed at least annually and revised if necessary

- Review at the same time each year
- Can be revised at interim reporting periods if evidence suggests it's necessary
- May be revised outside the normal schedule in special situations:
- Pandemics that change mortality expectations
- Announcement of medical advancement that will improve future mortality
- Change in the competitive environment that will affect lapse rates (e.g. new competitor enters market)
- NPR should be recalculated from issue ("trued-up") whenever assumptions are revised

When the NPR is revised for any reason, the impact is captured separately as a remeasurement loss or gain

- Revisions that decrease (increase) reserves result in a remeasurement gain or (loss)

Discount rate $=$ upper-medium grade (low-credit risk) fixed-income instrument yield

- Usually interpreted to mean the yield on A-rated bonds
- Implication: all insurers will use rates that are similar in credit quality regardless of the assets actually held
- Can be a single rate or a yield curve
- Many practitioners believe it should be a curve since the discount rate must reflect the LFPB's duration characteristics
- If using a single rate, it should be consistent with the aggregate liability duration
- Maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when choosing the yield(s)
- If observable market data reflects transactions that are not orderly, the insurer can substitute its own estimates
- Insurer's estimates should be based on Level 3 in the ASC 820 FV hierarchy (described more later)

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{29}$ Basically, exclude any kind of expense other than LAE.

## Page 42
- Compared to prior standards, the current DR approach disconnects the DR entirely from the insurer's asset yields and results in DRs that are more consistent across all insurers


# Discount rates are always updated each reporting period 

- Update even if there were no cash flow assumption revisions or replacements of expected cash flows with actuals
- The impact of updating the discount rate is captured separately and recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI)
- Discount rate updates have no impact on regular income and no impact on the NPR (don't recalculate the NPR!)

If there is a deferred profit liability (DPL), everything above except for discount rate updating applies to the DPL as well (update for actual cash flows, revised assumptions) ${ }^{30}$

The details of these income impacts are covered in more detail in the upcoming sections and also through examples in the video lesson.

## Remeasurement Gain or Loss

When the NPR is updated with revised assumptions, it causes the LFPB to be different from what it would have been otherwise

This difference is recorded explicitly as a remeasurement gain or loss
Calculate beginning-of-period (BOP) (e.g. beginning of year, quarter, etc.)

- If done quarterly, the annual remeasurement gain/loss = sum of quarterly remeasurement gains/losses

Remeasurement Loss (Gain) = BOP LFPB Using Updated NPR - BOP LFPB Using Previous NPR

- If the updated NPR causes the BOP LFPB to be lower, this creates a gain; otherwise it creates a loss

The total benefit expense on the income statement can be broken down as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\text { Actual Benefits Incurred } \\
\quad+\text { Remeasurement Loss } & \text { (= Revised BOP LFPB - Original BOP LFPB) } \\
\text { + Change in Reserve } & \text { (= EOY LFPB - Revised BOP LFPB) } \\
\text { = Total Benefit Expense } &
\end{array}
$$

Where the "revised" LFPBs are based on the revised NPR (combination of updating for actual experience and/or revised future assumptions)

- The intermediate step of calculating the remeasurement loss essentially breaks the total reported reserve change into two pieces

The revised NPR and remeasurement gain/loss are always based on the original locked-in discount rate(s)

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{30}$ The DPL will be covered in more detail later in the chapter.

## Page 43
- I.e. do not use the current discount rate at this step
- When the discount rate is updated, the impact of the updated discount rate is recorded in OCI
- The NPR used in the OCI calculation should reflect any revised assumptions

This same process above applies to any DPL
Explaining how/why the reserve changed can be challenging and may require significant analysis

- The change in reserve for newer policies is affected more by PV effects since there are more future cash flows
- Opposite is true for older policies, which have future cash flows remaining until the end of the contract
- The higher the NPR is, the more sensitive the reserve will be to changes
- Expect maximum volatility when the NPR is capped at $100 \%$
- Many experience or assumption changes impact both benefits and premiums
- Deviations in current experience also impact future experience (e.g. if DBs or lapses are higher than expected in the current period, there will less future inforce)
- If experience is only updated annually, the impact will be affected by deviations in prior periods (may result in larger impacts)
- $1-\mathrm{NPR}=$ the insurer's best estimate of premium profit margin (excluding DAC and nonLAE)
- This will change each time the NPR changes

See the video lesson for numerical examples of how to calculate benefit reserves, NPR changes, etc.

# Discount Rate Revisions 

Discount rates should be updated at each reporting date (e.g. quarterly) to reflect current the upper-medium grade yields

The impact of updating discount rates is recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{OCI}_{t} & =\mathrm{AOCI}_{t}-\mathrm{AOCI}_{t-1} \\
\mathrm{AOCI}_{t} & =\text { accumulated OCI at time } t \\
& =\mathrm{LFPB}_{t} \text { based on original } \mathrm{DR}-\mathrm{LFPB}_{t} \text { based on current } \mathrm{DR}
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, insurers will have to continue calculating the policy liability using the at-inception discount rate so they can calculate the difference above

The NPR and all previously discussed reserve calculations at each reporting date are always based on the original discount rate(s) at inception

## Page 44
- The increase in reserve is based on the locked-in discount rate is called "interest accretion"

The video lesson includes a numerical illustration of this concept.
The main idea is to ensure that the "normal" part of the income statement is always based on the same DR from inception. Even though I've never seen GAAP literature refer to it this way, you can basically think of the LFPB valued at current discount rates as the "fair value" of the liability. This makes the liability more consistent with AFS assets backing the liability-both are effectively carried at FV on the GAAP balance sheet. OCI reflects the change in the current liability based solely on changing the DR assumption period to period and helps "connect" the income statement to the balance sheet, so to speak. Changes in the FV of AFS assets are treated the same way but have the opposite sign since a liability is the negative of an asset, or vice versa.

# Recording effects of discount rate changes in OCI should reduce GAAP equity volatility because it will offset OCI from AFS securities 

- Insurers commonly use assets classified as "available for sale" (AFS) to back insurance liabilities
- AFS assets are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in FV reported in OCI
- Changes in interest rates result in offsetting OCI between the liabilities and assets ${ }^{31}$


## Approaches for the Locked-In Interest Accretion Rate

The ASU does not specify how to calculate the locked-in interest rate used for interest accretion, but several approaches could be used

1. Spot rate approach - apply the spot rate to each year-specific cash flow

- Always use the original spot rate for each cash flow through time
- This method requires tracking the liability through time using the original term structure of the cash flows

2. Forward rate approach - apply implied annual (year-specific) forward rates to the total liability balance each year

- Calculate annual forward rates implied by the spot curve first
- As the liability moves through time, use the appropriate forward rate for each year using the original term structure developed at issue
- This method does not require keeping up with the original cash flow term structure since the forward rates vary by year

3. Effective yield approach - apply a constant IRR to the total liability balance all years

- Calculate an implied IRR based on the spot curve and cash flows at inception

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{31}$ When interest rates rise, discount rates will rise, which will lower the liability (create positive OCI). Rising interest rates also lower the market value of assets, which would result in negative OCI.

## Page 45
- This method also does not require keeping up with the original cash flow term structure and simply uses a constant rate

If premiums are payable over multiple years and the yield curve has a normal upward slope, the effective yield may exceed long-term spot rates

- Results from the "leveraging effect" of premiums exceeding benefits in early years then reversing in the future ${ }^{32}$
- Can cause spot rate accretion to be higher than under the effective yield method
- Spot rate-base interest accretion may be a better match with investment income

The forward rate approach usually produces the lowest accretion and lowest reserves in early years

- However, lower early accretion means that accretion will be higher in later years (may exceed investment income)
- Forward curves tend to have steep slopes and sometimes dips/spikes, which will affect interest accretion

These approaches are virtually impossible to understand without going through an example, so be sure to check out the video lesson for that.

# DPL for Limited-Pay (LP) Contracts 

LP contracts have premium payment periods are that shorter than the coverage period

- Single-pay, 10-pay, 20-pay, payments to age 65, etc.

LP contracts follow the same accounting model for traditional long-duration contracts but also require a deferred profit liability (DPL) when the NPR $<100 \%$

- DPL is based on gross premium received in excess of net premium used in the benefit liability
- Amortize the DPL against the discounted insurance inforce (or benefit payments for lifecontingent payout annuities ${ }^{33}$ )

Without a DPL, LP contracts would generate high profits during the premium-payment period, followed by negative earnings after premiums stop (not desirable under GAAP)

## DPL calculation steps:

1. Determine the amount of annual profit to defer

$$
\text { Profit }_{t}=(1-\mathrm{NPR}) \times \mathrm{GP}_{t}
$$

${ }^{32}$ Premiums will typically be higher than DBs early in the life of the policies because the insurer has to charge enough premium to not only cover current DBs but also build a reserve for future DBs.
${ }^{33}$ Life-contingent payout annuities are treated much like traditional long-duration contracts under GAAP and since they involve a single premium upfront, they are also LP contracts. These will be covered in detail in Ch. 12, including their DPL mechanics.

## Page 46
Profit is a BOY value since it's based on premiums (equals zero after the premium payment period ends) ${ }^{34}$
2. Calculate DPL the as a constant $\%$ of inforce

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{DPL} \% & =\frac{\mathrm{PV}_{0}(\text { Profit })}{\mathrm{PV}_{0}\left(\mathrm{BOYIF}^{*}\right)} \\
\mathrm{DPL}_{t} & =\mathrm{DPL} \% \times \mathrm{PV}_{t}\left(\mathrm{BOYIF}^{*}\right)-\mathrm{PV}_{t}(\text { Profit }) \\
& =\left(\mathrm{DPL}_{t-1}+\text { Profit }_{t}\right) \times(1+i)-\mathrm{DPL} \% \times \mathrm{BOYIF}_{t-1}^{*}
\end{aligned}
$$

The BOYIF term is exactly the same amortization basis we used for DAC in Ch. 4, but unlike DAC, we are discounting it with interest in the DPL framework. In the GAAP book authors' DPL example, they treat the BOYIF as though it occurs EOY for interest discounting. ${ }^{35}$ This treatment of the inforce is different from all other examples in the book, but we recommend being consistent with the authors' approach for exam purposes, and we're denoting it BOYIF* as a reminder. See the video lesson for more comments.
3. The change in DPL each period is included in the benefits section of the income statement

- As profit is being capitalized, the DPL rises to offset and defer it
- The DPL declines each period after premiums end releasing profit into income

See the video lesson for a numerical example and more explanation.

# Use the same cash flow assumptions and accretion rates used for the LFPB 

- Update experience and assumptions at the same time the LFPB is updated
- The DPL does not get updated to reflect current discount rates (no OCI impact)


## Claim Liabilities

Claim liabilities are established for:

- Pending death claims (insurer has been notified of death but the claim hasn't been paid yet)
- Resisted claims ${ }^{36}$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{34}$ Keep in mind this is not the "real" profit. It completely ignores all expenses other than LAE since non-LAE expenses are ignored by the LFPB. It also ignores actual investment income and DAC amortization. Before ASU 2018-12, the DPL actually accounted for a more realistic measure of profit that included expenses, but that's no longer the case under ASC 944. However, the current framework still accomplishes the goal of making GAAP earnings smoother by spreading the excess premium load out over a longer period.
    ${ }^{35}$ It's very confusing on the surface because the explicitly label the inforce column in Table 5-7 "BOY," but on the next page, they acknowledge that they are discounting it at EOY when they say "For simplicity, Table 5-7 assumes that all premiums are received at the start of the period and that all claims and lapses occur at the end of the period, so the beginning of period insurance in force is a good representation of the insurance coverage provided throughout the period."
    ${ }^{36}$ The chapter does not define this, but it refers to claims where the insurer is disputing their obligation to pay the claim, perhaps on legal grounds.

## Page 47
- Incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims ${ }^{37}$


# Characteristics of claim liabilities: 

- Usually not discounted since they will be paid out soon
- Less significant than other types of insurance (e.g. health) because life claims are paid quickly
- Claim liabilities for future policy benefits (IBNR) can be shown separately on the balance sheet or included with the LFPB
- The change in total IBNR must be allocated to cohorts using a "rational allocation" method
- Liabilities for pending/resisted claims can be tied to their original cohort more easily


## Premium Accruals

These are reported separately on the GAAP balance sheet:

- Advance premium liability - established to offset premiums paid in advance (released when premium due date arrives)
- Receivable asset for due and unpaid premiums - established to increase income in place of premiums (released when premiums are actually paid)

These should be netted against or added the GAAP reserve (don't report separately):

- Deferred premium asset for non-annual modes (relevant to mean reserves)
- Unearned premium liability (relevant to midterminal reserves)


## Cash Flow Assumption Considerations

Some of the detail that appears in the chapter at this point for cash flow and discount rate assumptions has already been incorporated into earlier material in our detailed study manual.

- ASOP 10: guidance on setting GAAP assumptions
- Assumptions should be best estimates without conservatism or provisions for adverse deviation (PADs)
- Best estimate refers to the "most likely, average, or central" outcome
* Corresponds to the mode, mean, or median of a probability distribution
* Other interpretations are possible
- Considerations when selecting best estimate assumptions:
* Characteristics/magnitude of the company's business

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{37}$ At any given time, some amount of insureds have died but the insurer has not yet been notified. This is essentially an estimate of claims that will soon be pending once the insurer is notified.

## Page 48
- Maturity of the company and growth rate
- Company's prior experience and experience trends
- Medical, economic, social, and technological developments
- Actual recent company experience data if relevant and credible
- Relevant industry data that can supplement company experience
- ASOP 23 gives guidance on data quality issues


# - Mortality 

- Typically based on company experience studies
- New products may require industry experience, adjusted as needed
- Reflect marketing and underwriting practices
- Historical mortality improvement can be reflected if the actuary believes it will continue
- Mortality can be dependent on lapses (e.g. healthy lives more likely to lapse when premiums increase)


## - Lapse rates

- Take into account characteristics like: face amount, issue year/age, duration, premium paying period/frequency
- Composite rates should account for the current and future mix of business in the cohort


## - Assumptions for premiums that aren't fixed

- Most nonpar trad contracts have fixed premiums
* Fixed premiums are a contract parameter, not an assumption
- Some contracts have adjustable premiums
* Many term policies have premiums that can be adjusted up to a contract maximum
* Indeterminate premium contracts have premiums that can be reset prospectively if assumptions change ${ }^{38}$
- Adjustable premiums require a best estimate assumption that considers:
* Current premium levels
* Historical premium patterns
* Expectations of future increases/decreases

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{38}$ These usually take the form of a nonpar WL policy and were introduced in the 1970s and 1980s when interest rates were very high and volatile.

## Page 49
- Contractually guaranteed maximum premiums
- The LFPB is based on the best estimate assumption for future premiums, and updated with actual premiums when the NPR is unlocked
- Indeterminate premium policies with either of the following characteristics should be accounted for as UL-type contracts under ASC 944:
- Stated account balance with interest credits and charges that are not fixed and guaranteed
- Changes in contract elements are based mainly on changes in interest rates or market conditions instead of group experience
- Indeterminate premium contracts without the above characteristics are accounted for as nonpar traditional life


# - Coupons, dividends, and conversion privileges 

- Account for any coupons, endowments, and conversion privileges in the LFPB
- Dividend-paying policies that don't follow the contribution principle (described earlier):
- Dividend revisions may follow a different schedule than other assumption revisions
- The slope of dividend scales will impact the LFPB
- May create anomalies - e.g. increasing future investment return assumption in dividends will increase the LFPB without a corresponding credit from the asset side
- Policyholder dividend option utilization is usually not reflected in the LFPB (i.e. assume dividends are always paid in cash)
- If dividends are restricted by regulation, establish a UPPEA (described later)


## - Expenses

- Include expected nonlevel costs (termination, settlement costs) in the LFPB (i.e. LAE)
- Also reflect inflation expectations
- Capitalize deferrable acquisition costs in DAC
- Expense all other costs as incurred


## - Taxes

- Ignore premium taxes and FIT in the LFPB and DAC
* Exception: premium taxes on LP contracts may be deferrable ${ }^{39}$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{39}$ This detail was not mentioned in Ch. 4 but appears in Ch. 5

## Page 50
# Discount Rate Considerations 

## - Handling multiple issue dates (yield curves) within a cohort

- Could use a weighted average (e.g. by premium) or just take a straight average
- Could average only key dates (e.g. month-ends) instead of every issue day
- Discount rates should reflect the interest rate environment when the contracts were actually sold
* This may eliminate simple approaches like using a yield curve from a single point (e.g. BOY, mid-year, or EOY)
- A provisional yield curve can be used for interim reporting (e.g. quarterly) in the first issue year until the final yield curve(s) are known
* The final yield curve(s) would be locked in at the end of the issue year
- Could create monthly or quarterly sub-cohorts, each with their own discount rates
* NPR is still determined at the total cohort level (and cap applied at cohort level)
* Avoids needing provisional yield curves


## - Dealing with unobservable rates

- Insurance liabilities often much longer than the longest observable liquid interest rate (usually 30 years)
- Techniques for estimating long-dated interest rates:

1. Interpolate between the last observable rate and an assumed long-term rate ${ }^{40}$
2. Determine a forward rate based on the last observable rate and extrapolate rates beyond $\mathrm{it}^{41}$
3. If the risk-free curve extends beyond the A-rated curve (common), assume Arated spreads are constant and add them to risk-free rates

* This can be used in conjunction with the other methods to extend the last observable rate
- Guidance for estimating unobservable rates is based on ASC 820 level 3 measurement:
* Reflect assumptions that market participants would to price the asset or liability, including risk assumptions
* Guidance for incorporating assumptions about risk:
- Includes risk in both the valuation technique and its inputs

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{40}$ The authors do not specify how to determine the long-term rate assumption.
    ${ }^{41}$ The authors do not explain how to determine the forward rate or how to extrapolate it.

## Page 51
- Use a risk adjustment (margin) if there is significant measurement uncertainty due to lack of market activity (i.e. reduce the best estimate interest rate to reflect uncertainty)
- Insurer may need to use its own data but should adjust it to reflect a market participant's perspective
- Does not need to be an exhaustive effort
- Methods for dealing with foreign currencies that don't have A-rated securities:
- Use the highest available rating instead
- Subtract an assumed spread from the highest rated rates


# Expense Recognition 

This section of the chapter summarizes information from Ch. 4 on expense recognition, DAC amortization, etc. The only pertinent new piece of information is shown below.

For policies with non-level DBs (e.g. decreasing term), some insurers use initial DB inforce as the DAC amortization basis to avoid letting the varying DB affect the amortization pattern

- However both methods are seen in practice


## Riders

Common riders on traditional life insurance policies:

- Option to purchase additional insurance without underwriting
- Waiver of premiums on disability
- Extension of maturity date
- Early payment of DB on critical illness
- Accelerated or extended benefits to cover LTC expenses

If the rider can't exist on a standalone basis, treat the base + rider as a single unit (most common situation)

- Include rider charges and benefits in LFPB
- Include deferrable acquisition costs for the rider in DAC
- Riders are often profitable, which will cause the NPR to be lower than riderless contracts

Riders that insure against different risks than the base contract may need to be separated

- Examples: disability income riders ${ }^{42}$ and riders that cover a different insured (e.g. spouse)
${ }^{42}$ This is not the same thing as the disability waiver rider. A disability income rider provides some income benefit on disability, while a disability waiver rider waives the premiums on the base contract. A premium waiver rider would not be separable.

## Page 52
- Assumptions should be internally consistent with the base contract (e.g. rider lapse assumption should be $\geq$ base lapse assumption)
- In some situations, insurers set the rider GAAP reserve equal to the stat reserve
- Appropriate if not materially different

Valuation approaches for disability waiver riders that have not been triggered:

1. Gross approach - value rider separately from the base contract

- Reserve $=$ PV expected waived premiums $-\mathrm{NPR} \times \mathrm{PV}$ expected rider charges

2. Net approach - integrate rider with base contract

- Reduce base contract premiums for expected waived amounts

Approaches for setting mortality assumptions on contracts that have a disability waiver rider

- Use a higher mortality assumption for contracts with active disability (lower for contracts not on disability)
- Use an averaged mortality assumption for all contracts (disabled or not)

The credibility and availability of disabled life mortality data may guide the approach used

# Restricted Participating Life 

This section is relevant to stock companies who offer dividend-paying policies that do not follow the contribution principle and who also restrict dividends payable to shareholders. "Restricted dividends" refers to the restricted shareholder dividends.

In some cases, state/federal law, company charter, or the policy form itself will restrict dividends payable to stockholders to protect policyholders' share of profits, which will be distributed through future policyholder dividends

- The policyholder's share of profit is excluded from stockholder equity and credited to par policyholders' funds

If there are no restricted dividends, then any policyholder dividends paid by a non-contribution principle are included as another benefit in the LFPB

If there are restricted dividends, the insurer must establish a separate liability for the dividends called an undistributed participating policyholders' earnings account (UPPEA)

- Purpose: defers profits that will eventually be returned to policyholders through dividends so that the profits are not reported in current income
- Do not include the dividends in the LFPB since they'll be accounted for in the UPPEA

The book shows a simple example where stockholder dividends are restricted to be no more than $10 \%$ of stat profits before policyholder dividends. The formulas below are implied by the example. If the restriction was something other than $10 \%$, you can just change that factor. Note that even if the restriction is based on stat income, you should still use GAAP income in all the UPPEA calculations because UPPEA is specific to GAAP.

## Page 53
1. Project the GAAP income statement (premiums, investment income, benefits, costs, DAC amortization, etc.)
2. Calculate GAAP net income (revenues minus expenses) ignoring policyholder dividends
3. Calculate a running total of GAAP surplus before policyholder dividends

$$
\text { CumSurplus }_{t}=\text { CumSurplus }_{t-1}+\text { NetIncomeBefore }_{t}
$$

4. Calculate a running total of policyholder dividends paid
5. $\mathrm{UPPEA}_{t}=0.90 \times$ CumSurplus $_{t}-$ CumPHDivs $_{t}$

- I.e. set aside a liability for the policyholders' share of cumulative profit ( $90 \%$ ) in excess of the profit that has already been distributed to policyholders through past dividends

6. Final GAAP net income:

$$
\text { NetIncome }_{t}=\text { NetIncomeBefore }_{t}-\text { PHDivs }_{t}-\Delta \text { UPPEA }_{t}
$$

See the video lesson for an example.
Shadow UPPEA maybe be needed to offset OCI generated by AFS assets backing the liability ${ }^{43}$

- The shadow UPPEA would be included with the UPPEA liability on the balance sheet with changes in the shadow UPPEA through OCI


# Profit Emergence 

This section of the book shows a nice example of profit emergence. We're summarizing the key formulas implied in their framework below. The video lesson demonstrates how these formulas work through an example as well.

GAAP net income $=$ GAAP Revenue - GAAP Expenses

- GAAP Revenue $=$ Premiums + Net Investment Income
- GAAP Expenses $=\mathrm{DBs}+\mathrm{SBs}+$ Increase in LFPB + Non-Def Expenses + DAC Amortization

Alternatively, GAAP net income can be expressed as the sum of earnings sources: ${ }^{44}$
(-) Acquisition Costs = DAC Amortization + Non-Deferrable Acquisition Costs
(+) Interest Spread $=$ Net Investment Income - Interest Accretion
Net Investment Income $=$ Gross Investment Income - Investment Expenses
(+) Premium Loading = Gross Premiums - Net Premiums

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{43}$ The authors do not explain how to calculate shadow UPPEA, but presumably you would follow all the same steps outlined for the regular UPPEA except that you would include any unrealized gains/losses on investments in net income (i.e. assume unrealized gains/losses are realized).
    ${ }^{44}$ We're using $(+)$ and $(-)$ to indicate whether you add or subject each line's result.

## Page 54
(-) Other Expenses = maintenance expenses, renewal commissions, premium taxes, overhead, and any other expense not included elsewhere
(-) Benefit Deviation = Actual Benefits Paid - Benefits Assumed in LFPB
(+) Other Reserve Unlocking $=$
$(+)$ ALEPB Before NPR Unlocking - $\triangle$ LFPB After NPR Unlocking
(+) Interest Spread Before NPR Unlocking - Interest Spread After NPR Unlocking
(+) Premium Loading Before NPR Unlocking - Premium Loading After NPR Unlocking

# Other Considerations 

- Interim reporting - many insurers report GAAP earnings on an quarterly basis
- Quarterly earnings will be more volatile for insurers who choose not to update the NPR each quarter
- Prior quarterly results in the year cannot be restated at EOY (must stand on their own)
* This means that DAC amortization, remeasurement gains/losses, etc. will be different than if the insurer did all calculations in annual time steps ${ }^{45}$
- Disaggregated rollforward disclosures
- Key disclosure: YTD disaggregated tabular rollforward of the GAAP reserve from the beginning to ending balance
* Must be gross of reinsurance recoverables and include any DPL

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{45}$ The wording in the chapter is not very specific, but it seems to imply that if an insurer does quarterly reporting, items like the remeasurement gain/loss would be benchmarked to the BOQ instead of BOY even though the insurer would still need to ensure all actual cash flows for prior quarters were included in place of expected cash flows. This may make one quarter especially volatile each year since it would be like the "catch-up quarter."

## Overview of This Reading

This reading is a spreadsheet developed by the SOA to illustrate basic concepts related to the traditional policy benefit liability and DAC calculation under ASU 2018-12

Like the PBR model spreadsheet we covered earlier in the course, the Instructions tab of this spreadsheet makes it clear that pretty much anything in the spreadsheet if fair game to be tested-formulas and all. However, the formulas in this spreadsheet are generally much more straightforward, as this spreadsheet only covers very basic aspects of the calculations we've already covered in the GAAP book previously. There are also many calculations covered in the GAAP book that are not covered in this spreadsheet, so I think it's a good idea to just use this spreadsheet as a quick review.

## Instructions Tab

This tab describes the general purpose of the spreadsheet and also lists key expectations for exam candidates:

- Understand how changes to mortality and lapse experience drive changes in the level and patterns for DAC and reserves.
- Understand how changes to mortality and lapse assumptions drive changes in the level and patterns for DAC and reserves.
- Have a deep understanding of the mechanics for both the DAC and reserve calculations.
- Understand how DAC and reserves move relative to the underlying income impact from cash flows.
- Have a general understanding of all formulas in the workbook and be able to recreate calculations as needed.
- Responsible for understanding the questions and answers provided in the spreadsheet assignments


## FASB DAC Guidance Tab

This tab contains an excerpts from ASU 2018-12 that describe the DAC rules we have covered thoroughly in previous lessons

## DAC Example Tab

This tab shows a very simple example of DAC capitalization and amortization over a 5-year time frame. The methods here are identical to what we've covered previously. This tab is used to answer the DAC questions in the spreadsheet assignments.

## Page 57
# 20 YT DAC Tab 

This tab contains a more realistic DAC example based on a 20-year term policy, but all of the calculations are identical to what we've covered in earlier lessons.

There is also a short Q\&A section that makes the following key points:

- Renewal acquisition costs tend to increase the DAC amortization rate because the amortization ratio is recalculated as additional deferrable acquisition costs are incurred
- The amortization ratio increases when assumed future persistency falls (i.e. if you expect more lapses in the future, the DAC will amortize faster)
- No experience adjustments are allowed if persistency is higher than expected
- DAC should be zero when there are no more policies in force


## FASB Reserve Guidance Tab

This tab contains an excerpts from ASU 2018-12 that describe the changes related to traditional policy benefit liability calculation. Everything on this tab was covered thoroughly in previous lessons.

## Reserve Example

This tab contains formulas that calculate the benefit liability for a 20-year term policy. Various input cells let you change assumptions to see the impact on reserves. This tab is used to answer the reserve questions in the spreadsheet assignments.

## Spreadsheet Assignments

## Questions on DAC example, tab 20 YT DAC

1a. Assume experience emerges as anticipated in first 11 years. What is the experience adjustment for additional $20 \%$ termination in year 12?

- -11.70
- If terminations are higher than expected, the experience adjustment lowers DAC further

1b. In the baseline model, where experience emerged as anticipated, why did the amortization rate increase from 0.029 to 0.033 in year 10 and then stayed flat?

- Additional incurred deferrable acquisition costs increase the amortization ratio

1c. What is the impact on year 10 and year 11 DAC balances if lapses are increased 5\% starting in year 11?

- No impact on year 10
- If lapses increase in year 11+, DAC runs off faster (lower DAC balances)

## Page 58
# 2 Questions on reserve example, tab 20 YT Reserve 

2a. In the 20 YT Reserve example, assuming valuation year is 12 and no change in assumptions and experience emerges as anticipated through first 11 years, what is the impact on year 12 reserve due to $20 \%$ additional mortality in year 12?

- Reserve change if no experience deviation $=528.1-564.3=-36.2$
- Therefore, an additional $49.5-36.2=13.3$ of reserves are released to offset the higher benefit expense of $282-235=47$

2b. Continuing from 2a, what is the total impact on the reserve for additional $20 \%$ claims in year 12 and increasing future mortality assumptions by $20 \%$ ?

- The year 12 reserve increases from 528.1 to 771.2

2c. Assuming experience emerges as expected through year 11, what is the impact on reserve due to $3 \%$ increase in lapse in year 12 and in all future years? Explain the reason for the direction of the change.

- The year 12 reserve decreases from 528.1 to 471.4
- If lapses increase on a term product, there are fewer DBs payable in the future, so the reserve falls

## Ch. 7: Universal Life

Syllabus Page Range: Only sections 7.1-7.2 and 7.5-7.7 Only

## Overview of This Reading

In this chapter, we leave the traditional world behind and focus on UL-type contracts
GAAP reserving for a basic UL policy is extremely straightforward: the primary component of LFPB is simply the policyholder account balance (PHAB)

However, additional features like secondary guarantees can give rise to more complicated additional layers that have to be accounted for

The on-syllabus page range for this chapter serves to provide a fairly superficial view of UL GAAP reserving. Substantial portions of chapter (namely Section 7.3) provide much more detail, but they are not on the current syllabus.

## Key topics for the exam include:

- Definition of UL vs. UL-type contracts under ASC 944
- UL PHAB mechanics and terminology
- Considerations unique to IUL and VUL
- Sales inducement liabilities
- Loss recognition
- UL rider considerations
- DAC considerations
- Sales inducements


## Background and Classification

UL was introduced in the 1970s to combine death protection with an investment savings product Initial designs were simple (borrowed from WL and term concepts) but later expanded to variable UL (VUL), indexed UL (IUL), and ULSG

## Definition of UL-Type Contracts

"UL-type" contracts are a specific type of long-duration insurance contract under ASC 944
ASC 944 defines UL-type contracts by distinguishing them from other typical long-duration contracts:

## Page 60
- Terms are not fixed and guaranteed
- Policyholders usually have significant discretion over premium payments
- Insurers usually have significant discretion over amounts credited to account balances


# UL contracts usually share 4 common characteristics: 

1. Legally classified as life insurance contracts
2. Include at least one key element that is not fixed and guaranteed (premium, benefit levels, etc.)
3. Have an account balance (PHAB) into which premiums are deposited investment returns credited
4. Provide insurance coverage through the assessment of periodic charges to the account balance

The PHAB is usually explicit but can also be implicit
All UL contracts are "UL-type" under ASC 944, but not all UL-type contracts are UL
Examples of contracts that would likely be classified as UL-type under ASC 944 even though they are not called "UL":

- Interest sensitive WL (ISWL) - hybrid of WL and UL where premiums are fixed but adjustable by the insurer as interest rates and COI rates change
- Pre-need insurance - names a funeral provider as the beneficiary
- Premiums are fixed but may accrue PUAs using discretionary or inflation-indexed excess interest
- The PUAs are purchased with "excess interest credits"-like dividends on a par WL product except that the credits are fully discretionary and not based on the contribution principle

The products covered in this chapter focus on universal life insurance, but the designs could also be used for disability or LTCI, etc.

- Though these are rare, the accounting would follow the same concepts in this chapter ${ }^{46}$


## UL Mechanics and Terminology

A lot of the material in this section is a review of the same UL product concepts/mechanics covered in SVILAC Ch. 14 and other UL-related readings we covered in the statutory material.

Interest rate (or investment return) crediting mechanisms:

- Fixed UL - credited interest is based on a rate declared by the insurer

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{46}$ I.e. be ready for an exam question in the context of a universal LTCI product since question writers are enamored with rare situations and edge cases.

## Page 61
- VUL - PHAB goes up and down consistent with investment accounts the policyholder has chosen
- IUL - credited interest is based on the performance of an index like the S\&P 500 subject to participation rates, caps, etc. as described in Ch. 11 for indexed annuities

Cash surrender value (aka "cash value" or "surrender value") = PHAB - Surrender Charges
Surrender charges (SCs) - reduce the PHAB paid to the policyholder if they surrender the contract

- Usually expressed as an amount per 1000 of face amount
- Usually grade to zero over a 10- or 20-year period

Death benefit options ${ }^{47}$

- Option A: $\max ($ Face, PHAB $\times 7702$ factor $)$
- Option B: $\max ($ Face + PHAB, PHAB $\times 7702$ factor $)$
- Option C: $\max ($ Face $+\sum$ Premiums $-\sum$ Withdrawls, PHAB $\times 7702$ factor $)$

The " 7702 factor" is based on Internal Revenue Code Section 7702 factors, which are required so that the product has sufficient mortality risk ${ }^{48}$

Cost of insurance (COI) charges - deducted from the PHAB to cover the cost of DBs (usually monthly)

- May also include profit and expense margins
- $\mathrm{NAR}=$ net amount at risk ${ }^{49}=$ Discounted Face - BOM PHAB before COI and interest

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{NAR}_{t} & =\frac{\mathrm{DB}_{t}}{\left(1+i_{g}\right)^{(1 / 12)}}-\left(\text { PHAB }_{t-1}+\text { Prem }_{t}\left(1-\text { PremLoad } \%_{t}\right)-\text { ExpLoad }_{t}\right) \\
\mathrm{COI}_{t} & =\mathrm{COIRate}_{t} \times \mathrm{NAR}_{t} \\
i_{g} & =\text { guaranteed annual credited rate }
\end{aligned}
$$

- COI rates vary by issue age, sex, underwriting class, and attained age
- Can also be level or even decrease by age
- COI rates can usually be adjusted by the insurer based on mortality experience subject to a cap

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{47}$ Options A and B are also sometimes called options 1 and 2, respectively, in other readings.
    ${ }^{48}$ These are called "corridor factors" in the actual law. Much, much more detail on Section 7702 is covered later in the course in the tax section. Essentially, PHAB $\times 7702$ factor $=$ the current minimum DB required by tax law.
    ${ }^{49}$ The NAR formula in this chapter is fundamentally the same as the one in the SVILAC Ch. 14. This chapter only provides a single formula for COI, whereas SVILAC Ch. 14 provided two different formulas based on option A vs. B. The one in this chapter is like the option B formula in SVILAC Ch. 14. Some candidates get very stressed out about COI calculations. In practice COI can be calculated in many different ways, and it's not a detail to worry too much about for exam purposes.

## Page 62
- For less common products like ISWL, COI may be assessed annually

Partial surrenders - usually allowed and decrease both the PHAB and DB on a dollar-for-dollar basis

- Some products waive SCs on a portion of partial withdrawals

Premium timing and/or amount is usually at the discretion of the policyholder

- Maybe be subject to specified minimums or cumulative premiums
- Often constrained by tax law
- Premium paid by the policyholder can be based on their intended use:
- If the policyholder pays the minimum premium to keep the policy inforce, it's effectively term insurance
- Paying larger premiums makes the contract more investment-like (e.g. serve as a retirement fund)
- Initial premium is often a lump sum rolled over from another contract
- Target premium = usually defined as a basis for calculating commissions and as a tier above which $\%$ of premium expense charges vary


# Causes of lapse: 

- Voluntary surrender
- Failure to adequately fund the contract (automatic lapse if $\mathrm{PHAB} \leq 0$ )
- Contracts usually have a grace period during which the policyholder can rectify

No-lapse guarantees - 2 forms are common on newer UL contracts:

1. Cumulative premium design: policy stays inforce as long as $\mathrm{CP}+$ interest - withdrawals $>$ some minimum threshold
2. Shadow account design: policy stays inforce as long as $\mathrm{SA}>0$

- $\mathrm{SA}=$ a PHAB based on different loads, charges, and/or credited interest


## Policy loans are usually allowed

- Loaned balances usually have a different credited rate
- Credited rate may equal loan rate and/or be fixed or variable

Front-end loads (FELs) - a \% of premium charge sometimes assessed directly against the policyholder's premium

- More common on early UL
- FELs may be higher in the first 1-2 years
- Products that don't charge FELs generally rely more on ongoing fees or investment spread as a source of revenue

## Page 63
- Modern UL usually relies more on SCs than FELs

Most of the above elements (SCs, COIs, credited interest, loads, etc.) are subject to guaranteed levels

- COIs, loads, and other deductions can't exceed guaranteed levels
- Credited interest can't fall below guaranteed credited rates (doesn't apply to VUL)

Sales inducements that may be offered on UL contracts:

- Persistency bonus if the (e.g. increase PHAB by 5\% if policy stays inforce $N$ years)
- Refund of COI if the policy stays inforce $N$ years ${ }^{50}$
- Bonus interest rate paid in the first year

Commissions generally take 2 forms (often both types are paid):

- \% of premium: higher rate in year 1, followed by a lower renewal rate paid on premium in excess of target premium
- \% of PHAB: can be all years or only in later years

UL can also be sold on multiple lives (e.g. second-to-die policies are common in the estate planning market)

- COI rates are usually Frasierized ${ }^{51}$ so that all product mechanics are the same as a single life policy


# UL PHAB Monthly Processing 

The authors present a basic formula for computing the monthly PHAB that is very similar in concept to the UL account value formulas we saw in SVILAC Ch. 14. We've reorganized the formulas from this chapter into the following implied steps:

1. Credit premiums net of loads at the beginning of each month (BOM):

$$
\text { PHAB after prem and } \exp =\mathrm{PHAB}_{t-1}+\operatorname{Prem}_{t}\left(1-\text { PremLoad } \%_{t}\right)-\operatorname{ExpLoad}_{t}
$$

2. Calculate COI charge, which is also deducted at BOM:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{COI}_{t} & =\mathrm{COIRate}_{t} \times \mathrm{NAR}_{t} \\
\mathrm{NAR}_{t} & =\frac{\mathrm{DB}_{t}}{\left(1+i_{g}\right)^{(1 / 12)}}-\underbrace{\left(\text { PHAB }_{t-1}+\text { Prem }_{t}\left(1-\text { PremLoad } \%_{t}\right)-\text { ExpLoad }_{t}\right)}_{\text {PHAB after prem and exp }} \\
i_{g} & =\text { guaranteed annual credited rate } \\
\text { PHAB after COI } & =\text { PHAB }_{t-1}+\text { Prem }_{t}\left(1-\text { PremLoad } \%_{t}\right)-\text { ExpLoad }_{t}-\mathrm{COI}_{t}
\end{aligned}
$$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{50}$ This is really just another example of a persistency bonus.
    ${ }^{51}$ Frasierization is a technique that combines individual mortality rates into joint mortality rates. This is not explained or illustrated in the reading, however.

## Page 64
3. Credit interest using the current annual credited rate, $i_{c}$, at end of month (EOM):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Int }_{t} & =\underbrace{\left(\text { PHAB }_{t-1}+\text { Prem }_{t}\left(1-\text { PremLoad } \%_{t}\right)-\text { ExpLoad }_{t}-\mathrm{COI}_{t}\right)}_{\text {PHAB after COI }} \times\left[\left(1+i_{c}\right)^{1 / 12}-1\right] \\
\text { PHAB }_{t} & =\underbrace{\text { PHAB }_{t-1}+\text { Prem }_{t}\left(1-\text { PremLoad } \%_{t}\right)-\text { ExpLoad }_{t}-\mathrm{COI}_{t}}_{\text {PHAB after COI }}+\text { Int }_{t} \\
& =\text { PHAB at EOM }
\end{aligned}
$$

After presenting the formulas on a monthly basis, the authors show an example of how the PHAB would work on an annual basis, which is simpler (and probably more likely to be used in exam questions). The primary modification for annual processing is to use the full annual interest rates for $i_{g}$ and $i_{c}$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{NAR}_{t} & =\frac{\mathrm{DB}_{t}}{\left(1+i_{g}\right)}-\underbrace{\left(\text { PHAB }_{t-1}+\text { Prem }_{t}\left(1-\text { PremLoad } \%_{t}\right)-\text { ExpLoad }_{t}\right)}_{\text {PHAB after prem and exp }} \\
\text { Int }_{t} & =\underbrace{\left(\text { PHAB }_{t-1}+\text { Prem }_{t}\left(1-\text { PremLoad } \%_{t}\right)-\text { ExpLoad }_{t}-\mathrm{COI}_{t}\right)}_{\text {PHAB after COI }} \times i_{c}
\end{aligned}
$$

Another wrinkle that appears in the authors' annual example is that they show an annual policy fee, but this should be converted to a per unit basis for use in the formulas:

$$
\text { Policy Fee Per Unit }=\frac{\text { Annual Policy Fee }}{\text { Units Per Policy }}
$$

The policy fee per unit is then included in the ExpLoad term at BOY. Everything else in the annual example works exactly the same as the 3-step process outlined above for monthly processing. You're just doing it on an annual basis instead.

See the video lesson for an example of these concepts.

# Indexed Universal Life Insurance 

IUL contracts typically offer a fixed fund option that works exactly like a fixed UL contract's PHAB and also one or more index fund options

- Common indexes: S\&P 500, Dow Jones, Russel 2000
- Other indexes: bond, real estate, commodities
- Policyholders can choose how to allocate their money among the fixed and/or index fund choices
- If money is allocated to multiple funds, the contract must describe how fees will be allocated/collected
- Any deposits made between anniversaries are often held in the fixed fund, then rebalancing/transfers can occur on anniversaries

## Page 65
Index terms are commonly 1 year, and credits at made at the end of the index term

- Credits are based on index growth subject to participation rates, caps, and/or spreads

Insurers usually buy options to hedge index credits using an option budget for the contract

- Options are bought at the beginning of the index term
- The cost of the option as a $\%$ of PHAB is essentially a best estimate of the BOY credited rate $^{52}$
- The effective credited rate assumed in all examples $=$ option budget rate $\times\left(1+r_{f}\right)$ where $r_{f}$ $=$ risk-free rate
- The authors chose an option budget that results in exactly the same current annual crediting rate as the one used for the basic fixed UL product, so all PHABs end up being the same in the book's examples.

Monthly processing works like regular fixed UL with the following additional complications:

- COI and other charges may be deducted from the fixed fund only or prorated across index fund(s) and fixed fund
- Fees are usually subtracted from index funds before interest credits
- Index interest can be applied to starting, average, or ending PHAB
- Index interest is always credited at the indexing reset date (e.g. end of year for annual index terms)
- When a policyholder surrenders before an index reset date, remaining index credits may be forfeited or prorated (depends on the contract)


# Variable Universal Life Insurance 

Like IUL, VUL contracts usually offer a fixed fund option
With VUL, when the policyholder chooses to allocate some/all of their premium to variable funds, the premium is used to purchase "units" in separate account funds at current unit values (like buying shares in a mutual fund)

At any given time, the value of the variable funds $=$ number of units $\times$ unit value

- Therefore, the policyholder's variable funds will fluctuate with unit values (aka "net asset values")

VUL usually includes 2 types of fees not found on other UL:

1. Mortality and expense (M\&E) fee $=$ percentage deducted from the gross return on assets before determining the change in net asset value
[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{52}$ Keep in mind that the actual index credited rate will be based on the index performance subject to participation, caps, etc. But when doing projections, the option budget is like a best estimate of what the index credit will be.

## Page 66
2. Investment management fee (IMF) - percentage levied by the fund managers, which is also deducted from the gross return

The authors do not provide a formula for the change in unit value, but it's implied by what they say above. So, let $r_{t}^{u}=$ return on ( $\%$ change) in unit value:

$$
\begin{aligned}
r_{t}^{u} & =\text { GrossAssetReturn }_{t}-\mathrm{M} \& \mathrm{E}_{t}-\mathrm{IMF}_{t} \\
\text { UnitValue }_{t} & =\text { UnitValue }_{t-1} \times\left(1+r_{t}^{u}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Keep in mind that the gross asset return can be negative, so unit values and policyholder variable funds can go up and down

Both the M\&E fee and the IMF may have both a current rate and a maximum allowed guaranteed rate

# Products Without an Explicit Account Balance 

Pre-need insurance (described earlier) has no explicit account balance, and some forms of ISWL or "excess interest WL" do not either

These products may be classified as UL-type under ASC 944, however

## Additional Interest: Sales Inducement Liabilities

The liability described here is another element of the account balance defined by ASC 944. This information comes from Ch. 4, which we put off covering until this point in the course. All of the material here is relevant to not only UL but also deferred annuities, and we will see more examples in Ch. 11.

Ch. 4 uses the phrase "sales inducement liability," which is also sometimes called "the persistency bonus liability." However it's calculated (or however it's labeled) the liability is part of the account balance liability reported on the GAAP balance sheet.

ASC 944 defines sales inducements as amounts that:

- Are explicitly identified in a contract
- Paid in excess of current market conditions


## 3 main types of sales inducements:

1. Immediate bonus (day-one bonus)
2. Persistency bonus
3. Enhanced-crediting-rate bonus (paid in first year or first few years only)

SIs paid in the first year do not require an additional liability since they are already part of the PHAB

- However, the insurer may establish a sales inducement asset to defer recognition (covered later)

## Page 67
Persistency bonuses are a common example of something that gives rise to an "additional interest" liability

- These pay the policyholder an amount in the future if the contract is still inforce

Common examples of persistency bonuses:

- One-time bonus
- Higher credited rate
- Refund of some or all COI or expense charges
- Some other discontinuous increase to the PHAB

Since a persistency bonus isn't paid until a future date, ASC 944 requires the insurer to accrue a liability that is added to the PHAB when determining the LFPB

ASC 944 requires the liability to accrue ratably with no allowance for surrender decrements Possible methods:

1. Straight-line over the persistency period
2. As a level percentage of the account balance
3. As a level percentage of assessments (COI charges, investment spreads, and expense charges)

SILs are added to the account balance component of the LFPB
SIL accruals (changes) are included in benefit payments on the income statement
For example, assuming a constant credited rate $r$ and a persistency bonus will be paid at the end of the $n$th year: ${ }^{53}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { AccrualFactor } & =\frac{\mathrm{PB}_{n} /(1+r)^{n}}{\bar{a}_{\bar{n}}} \\
\text { BonusLiab }_{t} & =\left(\text { BonusLiab }_{t-1}+\text { AccrualFactor }\right)(1+r)-\mathrm{PB}_{t} \\
& =\frac{\mathrm{PB}}{(1+r)^{(n-t)}}-\text { AccrualFactor } \times \bar{a}_{\bar{n}-t}
\end{aligned}
$$

The accrual factor is a level BOY dollar amount that accumulates with interest to the persistency bonus amount

As the bonus liability increases each year, it reduces GAAP income (essentially like laying on an extra piece of credited interest)

At time $n$ when the persistency bonus is paid, the bonus liability will be exactly equal to that amount and will be released to offset it

The net effect is to spread the expensing of the persistency bonus over the $n$-year period (so it doesn't hit income all at once at time $n$ )

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{53}$ These formulas are implied by the example in Table 2 and accompanying verbal description in Ch. 7.

## Page 68
The persistency bonus liability framework above assumes the bonus is known with certainty in advance

# In reality, the exact bonus timing and amount will probably not be known 

- In these cases, the liability must be recalculated from issue using the previous framework each valuation date to true it up

Another (simpler) method for truing up the bonus liability:

$$
\text { BonusLiab }_{t}=\text { Current Estimate of Future } \mathrm{PB} \times \frac{t}{n}
$$

This simplification described by the authors essentially just prorates the estimated bonus linearly over the bonus period. This appears in a part of Ch. 7 that is not technically on the syllabus, but it seems to be an example of the "straight-line method" briefly mentioned in Ch. 4. In the Ch. 7 example, the bonus is 5\% of the projected future PHAB at year $n=10$, but you could generalize this to any kind of future bonus (e.g. estimate of inception-to-date COI that will be refunded at time n.) Note that you would still need to project the PHAB through year $n$ (along with COIs and anything else that affects the PHAB) to calculate the estimate of the PB.

Please see the video lesson for examples and additional explanation.
We will now jump ahead to the next section on the current syllabus (Section 7.5.)

## Universal Life Insurance Features

- No Lapse Guarantees (aka "secondary guarantees")
- Keeps the policy inforce even if the PHAB or CSV $\leq 0$
- Exposes the insurer to other-than-nominal capital markets risk because the SG is triggered when credited returns are insufficient
* But these are NOT MRBs since they relate to life insurance coverage
- Almost always require a liability for profits followed by losses ${ }^{54}$
* Excess benefits $=$ DBs paid when PHAB is exhausted


## - VUL Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit Riders

- Equivalent to NLG riders and follow the same basic GAAP approach:
* Rider is reserved with the base policy on a consolidated basis
* May require a liability for profits followed by losses
- Not a MRB since it's a component of a life insurance contract

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{54}$ This is a special type of liability that is covered in earlier off-syllabus sections of the chapter. It's an additional reserve that essentially capitalizes early profits into a liability to pay for higher future benefits.

## Page 69
- Long-Term Care Riders
- Usually provide LTC benefits based on an actuarially equivalent reduction in the death benefit or a policy lien
* No impact on GAAP reserves before a claim occurs
* If a LTC claim occurs, GAAP reserves on the base policy are adjusted to reflect DB reductions
- For riders that pay LTC benefits in excess of actuarially equivalent DB reductions: must test for profits followed by losses and hold a liability if necessary


# - Accelerated Death Benefit Riders 

- Typically provide a portion of the death benefit as an advance or lien when the conditions for acceleration are satisfied
- These should also be tested, but rarely require an additional liability


## - Waiver on Disability Riders

- Typically has a separate monthly charge assessed against the PHAB
* Vary by risk class, current/guaranteed, and attained age
- Come in 2 forms:

1. Waiver of deduction rider - waives COI charges on disability

- May have a waiting period or max attained age
* Rarely require an additional liability since rider charges usually have the same slope as the COI charges and normal mortality

2. Waiver of premium rider (rarer) - provide fixed and guaranteed benefits in situations where the base product has fixed and guaranteed premiums

* Typically separated from the base and valued separately like a traditional policy


## - Other features

- Term riders - commonly reserved for as standalone products
- Additional insured riders - commonly reserved for as standalone products
- Accidental death benefit riders - Typically require no additional reserve


## Deferred Acquisition Cost Asset

UL contracts follow the same approach for DAC accounting for long-duration contracts covered in Ch. 4

Identification of deferrable acquisition costs can be more complicated for UL due to premium flexibility and graded commission structures

## Page 70
# Examples of deferrable UL acquisition costs: 

- Premium-based commissions in excess of ultimate, long-term rates
- Commissions on dump-in premiums


## Examples of non-deferrable UL acquisition costs:

- Trail commissions (unless there is a declining rate)
- Costs that vary in constant proportion to premiums or insurance inforce


## Possible amortization bases for group DAC:

- Death benefits for products with level DBs (option A)
- NAR for policies with level NAR (option B)
- Policy count (sometimes used as long as policy size does not vary significantly)


## Sales Inducement Assets

Sales inducements paid in the first year (or first several years) may be eligible for deferral through a sales inducement asset (SIA)

Changes in a SIL for a persistency bonus can also be capitalized as incurred into an SIA
ASC 944 allows a SIA to be established if the SI is explicitly defined in the contract at inception and if it meets the following criteria:

1. Incremental to amounts the company credits on similar contracts that do not have the SI
2. Expected to be higher than the contract's ongoing crediting rates for periods after the inducement

SIAs are computed using the same amortization basis and method used for DAC

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { AmortRatio }_{t} & =\frac{\left(\text { SIA }_{t-1}+\text { Capitalization }_{t}\right)}{\sum_{t}^{n} \text { BOYIF }_{t}} \\
\text { Amort }_{t} & =\text { AmortRatio }_{t} \times \text { BOYIF }_{t} \\
\text { SIA }_{t} & =\text { SIA }_{t-1}+\text { Capitalization }_{t}-\text { Amort }_{t}
\end{aligned}
$$

The process and formulas are literally the same as DAC, but just remember that a sales inducement is not a deferrable acquisition cost. For example, bonus interest credited in year one is not an acquisition cost, so it would never be included in DAC. However, by including it in an SIA, the same goal is accomplished: smoother recognition of expenses and earnings. The SIA is also shown in the asset section of the balance sheet (don't net it with SILs).

## Ch. 11 Deferred Annuities

## Overview of This Reading

Deferred annuity GAAP accounting leans heavily on the accounting model we saw in Ch. 7 for UL-type business because most deferred annuities are technically UL-type contracts under GAAP $^{55}$

However, there are important implementation differences as well as completely new accounting concepts in Ch. 11 (e.g. market risk benefits)

ASC 815 embedded derivative accounting for index credits is also illustrated more clearly in this chapter

## Key topics for the exam include:

- Characteristics and types of deferred annuities
- Benefit reserves for indexed annuities
- Option budget method for indexed annuities
- Host contract valuation for indexed annuities
- Market risk benefits: definition and valuation framework
- Sales inducement accounting for deferred annuities
- DAC considerations for deferred annuities
- Profit emergence and income statement format


## Characteristics and Types of Deferred Annuities

## Characteristics of Deferred Annuities

- Account balance (PHAB) - the sum of all past deposits and investment credits less withdrawals and fees
- Premium pattern - single-premium (SPDAs) or flexible-premium (multiple payments)
- Load structure - contracts may have FELs deducted from premiums and / or back-end loads (surrender charges)
- Partial withdrawals - usually allowed, sometimes with a surrender charge

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{55}$ This unfortunately creates some fragmentation for certain topics mentioned in Ch. 11 where the book references parts of Ch. 7 that exam committee dropped from the syllabus starting in Fall 2025. We've tried to note where this happens.

## Page 72
- Surrender value - PHAB minus any surrender charges subject to minimum nonforfeiture values
- Possible crediting mechanisms:
- FDAs: credit interest at a guaranteed rate for a set period (usually 1 year), followed by subsequent rates guaranteed for renewal periods
- VAs: allow allocation of premiums to investment sub-accounts, exposing policyholder to downside risk
- Fixed indexed annuities (FIAs): credit amounts based on returns of a defined index, subject to participation rate and caps/floors
- Registered index-linked annuities (RILAs): similar to FIAs, but the PHAB may be reduced if the index performs poorly
- Fees - includes explicit fees, interest rate reductions, and/or charges for additional benefits
- Some contracts have a maintenance fee, waived if the PHAB exceeds a certain amount
- Sales inducements - immediate bonuses, persistency bonuses, or enhanced crediting rates
- Taxable nature - contracts can be funded with pre-tax contributions (in qualified retirement accounts) or non-tax-qualified contributions
- Guaranteed benefits - may contain GMxBs, guaranteed annuitization options, etc.

Very few deferred annuities are annuitized in the US (more common in other parts of the world)
The main attraction is the tax-deferred status (PHAB isn't taxed until it is surrendered)

# Fixed Deferred Annuities (FDAs) 

FDAs pay interest credits at the insurer's discretion (subject to guaranteed minimums) and are backed by assets in the insurer's general account

Common interest guarantee structures:

- Single-year guarantees - first-year rate is typically higher than renewal rates, which reflect the current market environment
- Multi-year guarantees - provide guaranteed interest rates for multiple years
- Early withdrawals may be subject to charges/adjustments based on current interest rates
- Insurer may renew the policy for another multi-year period or switch to a single-year guarantee
- Some allow free surrender at the end of each guarantee period
- Two-tiered annuities (aka "dual-fund annuities") - has 2 different PHABs: one used for cash surrender and one that can be annuitized (usually has a higher crediting rate)

## Page 73
# Variable Annuities (VAs) 

VAs allow policyholders to allocate funds to a fixed account and one or more investment subaccounts backed by separate account assets

## Defining characteristics of VAs:

- Investment options - may include a variety of equity, fixed income, and balanced fund options as well as a fixed fund
- Fees - includes M\&E charges and investment management fees
- Death and living benefits (GMxBs) - may offer GMDBs, GMIBs, GMABs, and GMWB/GLWBs based on:
- Return-of-premium (ROP): GMxB = total deposits less withdrawals
- Roll-up: GMxB = deposits less withdrawals, accumulated at a guaranteed interest rate
- Ratchet: GMxB resets at certain dates (e.g. anniversary) if PHAB > previous GMxB
- High-water mark: GMxB = max PHAB over a specified period of time
- Reset: GMABs may reset the starting minimum guaranteed value and begin a new guarantee period at certain dates


## Fixed Indexed Annuities (FIAs)

FIAs allow the policyholder to allocate money to an indexed account, which can rise with an index but protected from downside risk

FIAs are general account products and are subject to nonforfeiture law like regular FDAs
Option budget $=$ cost incurred by the insurer to fund index credits

- Usually based on expected investment income less a pricing spread
- Analogous to a credited interest rate on an FDA


## Defining characteristics of FIAs:

- Index used - S\&P 500 500, etc.
- Index crediting period - credits could be applied annually or based on index performance over a period of years
- Usually starts when premiums are deposited, but could be based on month-end values to simplify administration
- Flexible premium designs "bucket" premiums and track new index period for each
- Participation rate - percentage of index growth applied as an index credit (e.g. 70\%)
- Cap rate - max index credit allowed by the contract

## Page 74
- Floor rate - lowest index credit allowed by the contract ( $0 \%$ is common)
- Index spread - deducted directly from the index return before determining index credit (reduces index credit) ${ }^{56}$
- Guaranteed minimum rate - the lowest rate that can be credited over the life of the contract Simple example of an index credit formula: ${ }^{57}$

$$
\text { Credit }=\max \left[\text { FloorRate, } \min \left[\text { Cap, PartRate } \times \text { IndexReturn }- \text { IndexSpread] }\right]\right.
$$

Some FIAs follow a binary design:

- If the index return exceeds a specific \%, it credits a guaranteed rate
- Else, the credit is zero or something between zero and the index return


# Possible index credit approaches: 

- Point-to-point (PTP) - based on index performance between two points in time (1 or more years apart)
- Annual reset (1-year PTP) - index credits are applied at the end of each policy year
- Participation rate, cap, floor, etc. may reset for the next contract year
- Later, the authors refer to this design as a "ratchet-type" design
- Monthly average - based on the average index performance over a period of time
- High-water - based on the max index value over a period of time relative to the starting index

FIAs may offer GMxBs similar to VAs, but with less risk for the insurer since FIA account balances have much less downside potential

## Registered Index-Linked Annuities (RILAs)

RILAs are like FIAs where the policyholder shares downside risk with the insurer

- Like a hybrid between VAs and FIAs from the policyholder's perspective
- Key difference with a FIA: a RILA policyholder's PHAB may decrease

The policyholder's downside risk is limited in one of two ways (inverse of each other):

1. Floor: The policyholder bears losses up to a floor, after which the insurer bears all losses

$$
\text { Credit }=\max \left[\text { FloorRate, } \min \left[\text { Cap, PartRate } \times \text { IndexReturn] }\right]\right.
$$

This formula is identical to an FIA (excluding the spread for simplicity). The only difference is that the RILA floor is likely to be set lower than $0 \%$ (e.g. $-5 \%$ ).

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{56}$ This is what SVILAC Ch. 20 and other readings sometimes call a "margin."
    ${ }^{57}$ The mechanics covered in SVILAC Ch. 20 are also valid for exam purposes.

## Page 75
2. Buffer: The insurer incurs losses up to a buffer, after which the policyholder bears all losses

$$
\text { Credit }=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
\min [\text { Cap, } \min [0, \text { PartRate } \times \text { IndexReturn }- \text { Buffer }]] & \text { if IndexReturn }<0 \\
\min [\text { Cap, PartRate } \times \text { IndexReturn }] & \text { otherwise }
\end{array}\right.
$$

Please see the video lesson for an example of how RILAs work, including additional commentary on how the designs work and how they will produce different policyholder returns in different scenarios.

# GAAP Accounting for Deferred Annuities 

Deferred annuities are generally classified as long-duration contracts
If a deferred annuity has significant mortality or morbidity risk, classify as UL-type

- Follow the same significance ratio procedure described in Ch. 3 (DSM p. 16) to determine if excess payments are significant as a percentage of revenue
- Common examples: contracts with GMxBs, guaranteed annuitization options, etc.
- Follow the same accounting model covered in Ch. 7

Deferred annuities with no significant mortality or morbidity risk are classified as investment contracts

- Most fixed annuities (non-VAs) fall here since most are not sold with material guarantees in excess of the PHAB
- VAs without GMxBs would also be investment contracts

Whether or not a deferred annuity is classified as investment or UL-type, it essentially follows the same reserving rules covered for UL (Ch. 7) ${ }^{58}$

- The primary component of the LFPB is the PHAB
- Or in the case of indexed products: Host + VED
- Establish a URL for FELs, etc.
- Guaranteed payments in excess of the PHAB result in additional liabilities
- Examples: guaranteed annuitization options, GMxBs on FDAs, etc.
- Sales inducements require an SIL and/or SIA
- Unique to VAs: GMxBs are market risk benefits that must be fair valued

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{58}$ In practical terms, a basic deferred annuity without any extra guaranteed benefits is a UL product without COI charges or a DB in excess of the PHAB. The LFPB is often simply the PHAB, and the income statement geography is also the same.

## Page 76
# Benefit Reserves for Fixed and Variable Deferred Annuities 

FDAs and VAs use the same PHAB definition as UL-type contracts in ASC 944:
Deposits net of withdrawals

+ Amounts credited pursuant to the contract
- Fees and charges assessed
+ Additional interest (e.g. persistency bonus)
$\pm$ Other adjustments
As with VUL, VA PHABs should be based on the current fair market value of separate account assets (same "other adjustments" considerations)

If a contract has multiple PHABs, the reserve is based on the highest PHAB that could lead to cash surrender

- For two-tiered annuities, this will likely be the lower of the 2 PHABs since the PHAB used for CSV is typically lower than the one available for future annuitization


## Benefit Reserve for Indexed Annuities

As with IUL, the reserve for FIAs and RILAs is not simply the PHAB, but rather a host value plus the value of an embedded derivative (VED)

- ASC 815 classifies index credits as an embedded derivative that must be bifurcated and fair valued separately from the host
- ASC 815 expressly excludes index credits from the definition of an MRB ${ }^{59}$
- At issue, the host liability $=$ net premium collected - initial VED
- The initial VED is called the "host offset"
- At issue, initial host value + VED exactly equals the net premium (deposit) paid into the contract after deducting any FELs, etc. (no gain or loss at issue)
- After issue, the host liability grows at a break-even rate (IRR)
- The IRR is a solved-for rate at issue that grows the initial host value to the guaranteed maturity value of the contract
- The VED is always measured at fair value at each valuation date
- The host is treated as a debt-like instrument


## VED Valuation Considerations

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{59}$ The authors quote ASC 815 directly here: "Generally, the equity index feature represents a periodic interest crediting mechanism that affects the amounts credited to the contract holder's account balance, rather than representing a benefit in addition to the account balance that protects the contract holder from other-than-nominal capital market risk. . ."

## Page 77
- The index credit feature represents a single or series of European call options
- Paid only at the end of each term (but not on interim dates)
- Most common design: ratchet-type index credits (aka annual reset)
- Index interest is credited at the end of each year, then index parameters potentially reset for the next year
- Results in a compound embedded derivative: a series of "forward starting options"
- Estimating the index credit for initial vs. future index periods:
- Initial period: can use a closed-form solution like Black-Scholes since index parameters are known for the initial period (participation rate, cap, etc.)
- Future periods: requires a "less direct" method to account for the range of possible index parameters and index values
- The VED can become quite large over time
- Indexed funds grow and compound, resulting in larger and larger expected future credits
- Consistent with the idea that the embedded derivative is not truly settled until the policyholder receives the funds


# Option Budget Method 

The option budget method is a simplified single-scenario method commonly used in practice instead of doing a more complex stochastic valuation

- Based on the idea that the option budget (as a $\%$ of the index account balance) is a good estimate of expected annual index credits
- Usually based on product pricing
- Option budget $=$ expected yield on fixed income assets - pricing spread
- Fixed income yield is based on the company's target asset mix
- Some insurers assume a single option budget rate for all years; others vary it
- Contract cash flows are projected using the option budget rate and assumptions for mortality, lapse, and withdrawal
- VED $=\mathrm{PV}$ of excess benefits in this projection relative to the projected guaranteed PHAB
- Care should be taken to ensure the method follows ASC 815 requirements for fair valuation:
- Maximize the use of market-observable information
* How: use observable risk-free rates on valuation date
- Include a provision for nonperformance risk (own credit risk)

## Page 78
* How: add an adjustment to risk-free rates (increase them)
- Include a provision for uncertainty in cash flows
* How: adjust actuarial cash flows and/or decrease discount rates


# Alternatives to the Option Budget Method 

- Treat index credits as a partial net settlement of the embedded derivative
- VED $=$ PV of expected future index credits, not expected future CFs
- Many practitioners feel this approach violates the definition of "net settlement,"60 and this method is rarely used in practice
- More sophisticated stochastic approaches
- VED = average PV of excess index benefits over stochastic interest rate and equity scenarios
- Index credits vary by scenario based on assumed parameters
- Some insurers are beginning to use this in place of the OBM as computing/modeling techniques improve


## Host Contract Valuation

At issue, initial host value + VED exactly equals the net premium (deposit) paid into the contract after deducting any FELs, etc.

- Therefore, once the VED is calculated, the initial host value is just solved for as a balancing item

The host liability is analogous to a zero-coupon bond and grows (accretes) a break-even rate that causes it to mature for the guaranteed future account value

The 2 most common host valuation methods ("effective yield methods"):

## 1. IRR Method

- Solves for an IRR (effective yield) such that PV of past and future guaranteed CFs = host value at issue ${ }^{61}$
- Uses best estimate assumptions for future CFs
- Common practice: recalculate the IRR each valuation date to reflect actual cash flows and current estimates of future guaranteed CFs
- Current host value $=$ PV of future guaranteed CFs at the current IRR

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{60}$ The authors do not elaborate here, and I think the key takeaway for exam purposes is: don't use this method.
    ${ }^{61}$ The authors do not provide any formulas for this method in the book. These are some formulas implied by their example, which is just one possible interpretation and definitely the best approach for the exam. It's easier to understand the framework by going through the example in the video lesson.

## Page 79
- Controversial alternative: lock in the IRR from issue (some feel this doesn't uniformly spread the host adjustment over the life of the contract)
- Usually calculated at the cohort level


# 2. DIG B-30 Method ${ }^{62}$ 

- Similar to the IRR Method, but the solves for an IRR such that the initial host value equals the PV of the guaranteed minimum maturity value (GMMV) payable at maturity $(T)$ without decrements

$$
\operatorname{IRR}=\left(\frac{\mathrm{GMMV}}{\operatorname{Host}_{0}}\right)^{1 / T}-1
$$

- The IRR is locked in at issue and applied to the historical CFs on the contract
- Exception: can be unlocked if additional deposits or partial withdrawals occur
- Applied on a contract-by-contract basis

Insurers are not required to use either of the above methods and could use some other method as long as it involves an effective yield that treats the host as a debt instrument

## Additional Complications and Considerations

- How to allocate add-on deposits made after issue between the host and embedded derivative
- Common approach: allocate in proportion to the current host and VED values
* DIG B-30 Method: determine a new IRR based on the new GMMV
* IRR Method: determine a new IRR based on the new guaranteed benefit stream
- Alternative: determine the additional VED associated with the new deposit; additional host liability $=$ deposit - additional VED
* Advantage: prevents any gain or loss resulting from the new deposit
- How to handle transfers between different funds (e.g. between fixed and indexed accounts)
- Could treat a transfer from the fixed fund as an additional deposit in the indexed fund
- Many insurers do not assume future transfers and deal with them as they occur
- Others assume a long-term allocation mix and rebalance on each projected anniversary

62 "DIG" stands for Derivatives Implementation Group, which was a FASB group tasked with reshaping derivative accounting around the turn of the 21st century (before standards were codified into the modern ASC). The method here is based on one of their early examples in "issue B-30" which essentially treats the host as a simple zero-coupon bond that will mature for the GMMV. This works especially well for basic PTP designs where it's easy to estimate the GMMV based on a single premium paid at issue.

## Page 80
- Most insurers ignore add-on deposits and partial withdrawals in projections


# RILA Considerations 

The previous methods can also be applied to RILAs with very little adjustment
RILAs don't offer a zero floor and are not subject to strict nonforfeiture rules, so it's less straightforward how to allocate between guaranteed and excess benefits

Common solution: assume a GAV based on zero credited interest

- Some feel this is arbitrary but it provides reasonable results that align with FIAs

Even though RILA options are more complex, the option budget method is still applicable

## Market Risk Benefits (MRBs)

MRB = contract or contract feature that both provides protection to the policyholder from capital market risk and exposes the insurer to other-than-nominal capital market risk

- Most common example: GMxBs on VAs
- "Other-than-nominal" means that it varies significantly with capital market volatility
- Accounted for at FV and shown separately from other items in financial statements
- Change in FV goes through income except for the portion attributable to a change in the insurer's own credit risk, which is reported in OCI
- Criteria for evaluating whether a contract/feature is an MRB:
- "Protection" means the insurer is exposed to capital market losses when the AV < benefit offered (aka a "shortfall" in account balance)
- This risk has been passed from contractholder to insurer
- "Nominal risk" - risk amount is insignificant or has a remote probability of occurring


## Features that are not MRBs:

- DB protection provided by a life insurance contract
- Guaranteed minimum crediting rate on FDA


## Situations requiring judgment to determine if a feature is an MRB:

- Guaranteed annuity purchase rates that contain both capital market and mortality risk
- It may be possible to assess capital market risk if mortality and interest rates in the guaranteed purchase rates are defined
- A GMDB on a VA where the PHAB is so low that there is very little capital market risk remaining (more of a pure insurance contract)
- The probability of death is irrelevant-only the exposure to capital market risk matters

## Page 81
If any plausible scenario exists where the insurer would be exposed to significant capital markets risk, it would be "more than remote" (classify as an MRB)

# Valuation of MRBs 

## MRBs are measured at fair value at the individual contract level

- Aggregation is not allowed unless the resulting liability is not materially different than contract-level calculations

ASC 944 states that MRBs can be measured using either an option or non-option approach

- Under either approach, the initial gain or loss should be zero (at issue only)
- If a contract has multiple MRBs, they must be bundled as a single compound MRB

In practice, these option and non-option approaches have converged into a single, unified approach:

1. Identify the explicit fees charged to the PHAB

- Includes rider charges, M\&E, and asset-based charges
- Excludes investment margins (credited interest spreads) and surrender charges

2. Project all excess benefits and contract fees under a range of stochastic scenarios using market-consistent (risk neutral) assumptions
3. Calculate the PV of excess benefits and contract fees in each scenario

- Discount rate $=$ scenario risk-free rate + instrument-specific credit risk ${ }^{63}$

4. Average the PV of excess benefits and contract fees across all scenarios
5. Calculate the portion of the explicit fees attributable to the MRB: attributed fee percentage (AF\%), capped at $100 \%$ :

$$
\mathrm{AF} \%=\min \left(100 \%, \frac{\text { Avg PV of Excess Benefits }}{\text { Avg PV of Explicit Fees }}\right)
$$

$\mathrm{AF} \%$ is locked-in at issue and reused on future valuation dates (step 7)
As long as $\mathrm{AF} \%<100 \%$, there is no gain/loss at issue (value of MRB $=\mathrm{PV}$ attributed fees at issue)

- The cap is more likely to apply to FIAs that rely on investment margins to fund the MRB (since investment margins are excluded from the explicit fees)

6. If the $\mathrm{AF} \%$ is capped, lock it in at $100 \%$ and establish an "adjustment" liability to the value
[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{63}$ Also called "own credit risk" or "nonperformance risk" depending on where you are in the GAAP book.

## Page 82
of the excess attributed fees required at issue: ${ }^{64}$

$$
\text { Adjustment }_{0}=(\text { Uncapped } \mathrm{AF} \%-100 \%) \times \text { Avg PV of Explicit Fees }
$$

This "adjustment" is amortized over time

- Some insurers also ignore the explicit fees entirely in the MRB valuation and simply amortize the adjustment ${ }^{65}$

7. Calculate the MRB liability at future valuation dates using the locked-in $\mathrm{AF} \%$

$$
\text { MRB Liability }=\text { Avg PV of Excess Benefits }-A F \% \times \text { Avg PV of Explicit Fees }
$$

- If the liability is negative, the MRB is in an asset position (allowed)
- Any change in the MRB value due to instrument-specific credit risk that relates to the reporting entity should be recognized in OCI
- "Instrument-specific credit risk that relates to the reporting entity" = "own credit risk"
- Applies whether the MRB is in an asset or liability position
- Any change in credit risk other than own credit risk is reflected in net income along with all other changes in the fair value

Please see the video lesson for a detailed example of MRB valuation in the context of a GMDB. The example shows a multi-scenario approach and also demonstrates how to quantify changes in own credit risk.

If/when a policyholder exercises a GMWB or GMIB, the MRB is extinguished and a new contract begins with the appropriate liability

- For example, exercise of a GMIB results in a new payout annuity
- If the released MRB liability exceeds the new payout liability, the insurer establishes a DPL to defer the gain; otherwise record a loss immediately
- Any AOCI for the extinguished MRB is recognized in income

Practice varies when it comes to reflecting the impact of benefit utilization when the assumed probability of utilization $<100 \%$

- For example, a FV calculation may assume a 50\% utilization probability before election
- Two possible approaches if the benefit is elected:

1. Increase MRB FV to assume $100 \%$ probability before releasing

- More likely result in some DPL because of the larger MRB released

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{64}$ This is essentially a premium deficiency liability. It's the value of the MRB over and above what the max revenue stream can fund. The explicit fees are analogous to gross premiums. $\mathrm{AF} \%$ is analogous to an NPR.
    ${ }^{65}$ The authors mention this as an alternative but don't explain the rationale behind it.

## Page 83
2. Don't adjust MRB FV before releasing

# Valuation of Host Contract Associated with an MRB 

Conceptually an MRB is like an ASC 815 embedded derivative even though it's calculated according to the process specified by ASC 944 (outlined in the previous section). Like deferred annuity with a bifurcated ASC 815 embedded derivative, we have to identify the host contract and value it separately from the MRB.

Two possible interpretations of how to value the host liability associated with an MRB:

## 1. Use an effective yield method similar to FIAs

- This takes the view that an MRB is conceptually an embedded derivative (even though it's subject to ASC 944 MRB guidance)
- If the MRB is on an FIA, this approach is sometimes called "trifurcation"
- 3 distinct accounting items result: the VED for index credits, the MRB, and the host
- The host is automatically adjusted for both the VED and MRB

2. Recognize the MRB as a separate, distinct derivative (i.e. not an embedded derivative)

- Under this view, there's no need to identify a host
- Instead, establish an asset at issue to offset the initial MRB value, then amortize the asset over time "using a reasonable method"
- Some insurers use the same framework as SIAs or DAC for this
- Advantage: flexible and works even if there is no debt host (possible in some hybrid designs)
- In rare cases, the insurer will have to recognize a loss at issue if explicit fees aren't sufficient to fund the MRB


## Fixed Annuitization Benefits

Guaranteed annuitization benefits that expose the insurer to market risk are usually classified as MRBs

In rare cases, a guaranteed annuitization option may only guarantee the mortality rates used to calculate the annuity payment but not interest rates

- This would not be an MRB and would instead require an additional liability (SOP 03-1 liability) ${ }^{66}$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{66}$ SOP 03-1 is covered in section of Ch. 7 that is no longer on the syllabus, so there is not enough onsyllabus information to calculate it.

## Page 84
# Unearned Revenue Liability 

A URL is required for any unearned revenue (e.g. FELs) on a deferred annuity ${ }^{67}$

## Sales Inducements

All of the sales inducement considerations described in Ch. 4 and 7 apply to deferred annuities ${ }^{68}$

- Establish an SIL for persistency bonuses
- Capitalize day one bonuses and SIL changes into an SIA

This section of Ch. 11 provides yet another example of how one might calculate an SIL. In this example, the SIL accrues as a level $\%$ of the account balance.

How to accrue a persistency bonus SIL as a level $\%$ of the PHAB:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { DepositRatio } & =\frac{\mathrm{PV}(\text { Bonus })}{\mathrm{PV}(\mathrm{PHAB})} \\
\mathrm{SIL}_{t} & =\left(\mathrm{SIL}_{t-1}+\text { DepositRatio } \times \mathrm{PHAB}_{t}\right)-\text { Bonus }_{t}
\end{aligned}
$$

Consistent with the guidance in Ch. 4 and 7, the authors of Ch. 11 reiterate that the SIL should not be decremented for surrenders. Interestingly, however, the account value used in their example in Table 11.7 is decremented for surrenders in the source spreadsheet for the book. I would not do that on the exam. Please see the video lesson for an example and additional commentary on some of the quirks with this framework.

The authors of Ch. 11 also illustrate how to capitalize SIL changes into an SIA—something we've seen in previous chapters as well. In Ch. 11, they do it on a straight-line basis. Remember that SIAs are supposed to use exactly the same framework as DAC, but also remember that DAC can be calculated at either the contract level (on a straight-line basis) at the grouped level. Please see the video lesson for an example.

## DAC Considerations Unique to Deferred Annuities

- Deferrability of commissions on renewal deposits
- Additional deposits after issue are usually not required or expected on deferred annuities
* Any commission on an additional deposit after issue is fully deferrable (capitalize into DAC)
- Exception: deferred annuities sold in group pension plans often require additional deposits
* Commissions on these would not be deferrable
- Possible bases for group amortization:

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{67}$ URLs are also covered in section of Ch. 7 that is no longer on the syllabus. Ch. 11 doesn't provide enough information to calculate URL.
    ${ }^{68}$ This is another reference to a section of Ch. 7 that is no longer on the syllabus. However, Ch. 11 does show some SIL information we've covered in the course.

## Page 85
- Policy count
* May not align with contract size, so some practitioners avoid using
- Amount of deposits received
* Some practitioners add any additional deposits they are made (allowed)
- Never use account value as the amortization basis (affected by interest)
- Never reduce the amortization basis for partial withdrawals
- Violates the constant-level basis requirement and may cause the basis to become negative
- Amortizing straight-line at the policy level is allowed just like any other long-duration contract
- Maybe the best approach when there's no clear group amortization basis


# A Note about DAC for Investment Contracts 

As we saw in Ch. 3, ASC 944 defines any contract without significant mortality/morbidity risk as an investment contract (as long as it's not an ASC 606 services contract), and as noted in Ch. 4, investment contracts use the effective yield method for DAC. Most fixed and variable deferred annuities without guarantees that lead to benefits in excess of the PHAB will be technically classified as investment contracts.

However, the convention under US GAAP has long been to use the same DAC method for these contracts as other long-duration products as long as the contracts have surrender charges. ${ }^{69}$ Since virtually all deferred annuities have surrender charges, a deferred annuity classified as an investment contract will use the same DAC method we've used for all other long-duration contracts (even if it's beyond the SC period). This point is not made clear anywhere in the current edition of the GAAP book, but Ch. 4 does subtly mention the fact that an investment contract without SCs would use the effective yield method.

The current edition of the GAAP book does not demonstrate the effective yield method for a deferred annuity in any of the chapters included on the syllabus. In practice a deferred annuity without any surrender charges would be rare, so it probably wasn't a priority. In Ch. 12, we will see how to apply the effective yield method to payout annuities without significant mortality risk. That same approach can be used for a deferred annuity without surrender charges.

## Profit Emergence

The final section in the chapter illustrates how to calculate the profit for a deferred annuity under two formats: "cash flow based earnings" (essentially the same as a traditional product) and under the correct GAAP presentation for a deferred annuity (same as UL-type). The formulas implied in their examples are shown below. The video lesson contains a numerical example of both approaches and shows how they reconcile.

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{69}$ This convention arose back when DAC was amortized against the future margins of a UL or deferred annuity product. SCs were a significant component of that revenue stream, so it provided a basis for DAC amortization. Even though DAC has since been disconnected from revenue sources, the convention remains. These details are not on the syllabus, but are perhaps useful for historical perspective.

## Overview of This Reading

This very brief article gives an overview of the same MRB concepts covered in GAAP Ch. 11 and adds only minor detail relative to GAAP Ch. 11

## Key topics for the exam include:

- Assessing "other-than-nominal" capital market risk
- Process for calculating the MRB liability under the non-option approach


## Definition of a Market Risk Benefit

MRB = a benefit in addition to the account balance that protects a policyholder from other-thannominal capital market risk and exposes the insurance company to other-than-nominal capital market risk

The assessment of other-than-nominal capital market risk occurs at contract inception

- A guarantee could be an MRB in some economic environments but not others
- "Nominal" means "remote probability of occurring"
- "Other-than-nominal" also means "the benefit would vary by more than an insignificant amount in response to capital market volatility"
- Must consider a range of possible capital market scenarios (not just the current situation)
- Utilization assumptions should not be used in the assessment of other than nominal risk ${ }^{70}$


## Methodology Considerations

MRBs should follow FV accounting
Multiple MRBs on a single contract should be bundled into a compound MRB
MRB FV can be calculated using an option or non-option approach, which is more common
The non-option approach solves for an attributed fee such that the MRB value is zero at inception: PV(MRBs) - PV(Attributed Fees)

Inputs needed for MRB valuation:

- Risk-neutral interest and equity scenarios
- Own credit risk

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{70}$ This is because an MRB that is perhaps very out of the money might not have a high probability of utilization currently but could in the future.

## Page 88
- Policyholder behavior assumptions (lapse, withdrawal, and benefit utilization)
- Risk margins for unobservable inputs/assumptions

Many capital market assumptions are observable and do not require a risk margin

# Process for calculating the non-option MRB liability ${ }^{71}$ 

1. Project all excess benefits and contract fees across each RN scenario
2. Calculate the PV of excess benefits and contract fees in each scenario

- Discount rate $=$ RN interest rate + instrument-specific credit risk

3. Average the PV of excess benefits and contract fees across all scenarios
4. For newly issued policies, calculate the attributed fee percentage (AF\%)

$$
A F \%=\min \left(100 \%, \frac{\text { Avg PV of Excess Benefits }}{\text { Avg PV of Associated Fees }}\right)
$$

This will be zero gain/loss at issue unless $\mathrm{AF} \%$ would exceed the $100 \%$ cap, in which case there would be a loss at issue
5. Calculate the MRB liability at future valuation dates using the locked-in $\mathrm{AF} \%$

MRB Liability $=$ Avg PV of Excess Benefits - Avg PV of Attributed Fees

## Operational Considerations

The new disclosure requirements could require significant process/infrastructure changes, especially for companies who only calculated SOP 03-1 liabilities for GMxBs in the past

Much of the operational challenge will be related to the retrospective transition adjustment required for MRBs

- Will require work to rebuild models from the past so that calculations can be performed from the contracts' original issue dates
- Problems will likely arise from changes in software versions, data availability, lack of documentation, etc.

## Ch. 12: Payout Annuities

## Overview of This Reading

This chapter covers GAAP accounting for payout annuities, which differ from deferred annuities in that payout annuities make benefit payments to the annuitant (contractholder)

The measurement model for a payout annuity depends on whether it's an investment contract or an insurance contract

If it's an insurance contract, it follows the same guidance as traditional non-par long-duration insurance (Ch. 5), but there are some important implementation differences

If it's an investment contract, the measurement model is closer to a deferred annuity approach (UL-type), but there are also important implementation differences-namely for DAC

## Key topics for the exam include:

- Sources of and types of payout annuities
- Contract classification: insurance vs. investment
- Investment contract measurement: effective yield approach
- DPL measurement for life-contingent contracts
- Acquisition costs and DAC considerations unique to payout annuities
- Profit emergence


## Overview of Payout Annuities

Payout annuities provide periodic payments to the owner (annuitant)

## Sources of payout annuities:

- Direct sales
- Annuitization of a life insurance death benefit or deferred annuity PHAB
- Structured settlements from legal decisions
- Lottery prizes payable in installments
- GMIBs or GMWBs exercised on a VA
- Retirement income payments from defined benefit pension plans
- Income benefits from contingent deferred annuities


## Forms of payout annuities:

- Payment guarantee: can be life-contingent, term-certain, or both

## Page 90
- Can be fixed or variable
- First payment date: immediate or deferred
- Immediate payout annuities begin payments shortly after contraction inception
- Deferred payout annuities delay the first payment for at least 1 year


# Contract Classification 

Most payout annuities are classified as long-duration since they are expected to be inforce for an extended period

When a payout annuity arises from the proceeds of an existing life or annuity contract, establish a new contract for GAAP accounting purposes

As with other contracts subject to ASC 944, payout annuities must be assessed for mortality risk
Classify payout annuities as investment contracts if they do not have significant mortality risk, which means one of the following are true:

1. Probability of life-contingent payments is remote
2. PV of expected life-contingent payments relative to the PV of all expected payments under the contract is insignificant

If neither is true, classify as an insurance contract
Assessing the likelihood of life-contingent payments requires judgment

- Common threshold: significant means LC payments are expected to be more than 5-10\% of all payments

$$
\frac{\text { PV(LC Payments) }}{\text { PV(All Payments) }}
$$

Example of obvious investment contracts: term-certain payout annuities and structured settlements with large guaranteed lump sums

The classification of certain-and-life payout annuities can vary based on the issue age and termcertain period

- A 10-year certain-and-life payout annuity issued to a 65-year-old would be an insurance contract
- The same contract issued to a 100-year-old would be an investment contract (low probability of surviving the certain period)

Many payout annuities are classified as limited-pay contracts as long as they meet all of the following criteria:

1. Provide a specified benefit payment in exchange for a fixed premium

- Else, classify as UL-type (common for variable payout annuities)

2. Premium payment period < coverage period

## Page 91
3. Does not pay dividends

- Else, classify as participating life insurance

Virtually all fixed payout annuities will satisfy No. 2 since payout annuities are predominately single-premium products

In practical terms, a life-contingent fixed payout annuity is simply another type of insurance contract under ASC 944 and follows much of the same guidance we first saw in Ch. 5. The only differences arise due to implementation details (e.g. how to amortize the DPL.)

# Investment Contract Measurement 

Any payout annuity classified as an investment contract follows the usual rules for investment contract accounting (don't record premiums as revenue, etc.)

The net GAAP liability and DAC are determined using the ASC 310 constant yield method (aka effective yield method)

1. Solve for an constant yield (IRR), $r_{\text {gross }}$ such that:

$$
\mathrm{PVFB}_{0}=\text { Premium }
$$

2. Solve for another constant yield, $\left(r_{\text {net }}\right)$, such that:

$$
\mathrm{PVFB}_{0}=\text { Premium }-\mathrm{DAE}
$$

where $\mathrm{DAE}=$ deferrable acquisition expenses at issue
At each valuation date, calculate the LFPB and implied DAC balance:

- $\mathrm{LFPB}_{t}=\mathrm{PVFB}_{t}$ using $r_{\text {gross }}$
- Net GAAP Liability ${ }_{t}=\mathrm{PVFB}_{t}$ using $r_{\text {net }}$
- $\mathrm{DAC}_{t}=\mathrm{LFPB}_{t}-\mathrm{Net}$ GAAP Liability $_{t}$

Note that $r_{\text {gross }}<r_{\text {net }}$ because LFPB $>$ net GAAP liability
The framework above provides a way of calculating DAC on an "implied" basis. This DAC method is unique to payout annuities classified as investment contracts. See the video lesson for an example.

Remember that a payout annuity classified as an insurance contract follows the same DAC approach as any other long-duration life insurance product, even though there are unique considerations for the amortization basis (described later).

## Limited Pay Insurance Contracts

Life-contingent payout annuities follow the same guidance applicable as any other type of limited-pay insurance contract

The following aspects are unique to payout annuities:

## Page 92
- Aggregation and cohort grouping considerations
- As always, cohorts should contain contracts from the same issue year
- Individual sales and life insurance settlements are put in quarterly or annual cohorts
- Payouts from institutional channels (e.g. pension risk transfer) may be put in singlecontract cohorts (but not always) ${ }^{72}$
* Advantage of single-contract cohort: more specific assumptions and calculation simplifications
- Complexities arise when premiums are collected on different dates ${ }^{73}$
- Liability for future policy benefits (LFPB)
- LC payout annuities follow exactly the same guidance as traditional LD life insurance (Ch. 5), but since there is only one premium, the formula simplifies to:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{LFPB}_{t}=\mathrm{PVFB}_{t}-\mathrm{NPR}_{t} \times \mathrm{PVGP}_{t} \\
& \mathrm{LFPB}_{t}=\mathrm{PVFB}_{t}
\end{aligned}
$$

- All assumption rules are the same as traditional LD life insurance (review annually, etc.)
* But simpler since there's usually no NPR to true-up
- Include non-level claims settlement expenses (LAE), but the amounts usually aren't significant
* Typically this only applies to deferred life annuities where there will be an admin expense to establish benefits when they begin
- Follow the same discount rate rules as traditional life insurance (upper medium grade yield, capture OCI, etc.)
- Deferred profit liability (DPL)
- Based on the same guidance as traditional LD life insurance:
* With a single premium product, there is technically just one net premium (at time 0 ) equal to the PVFB
* Deferred profit at issue $=$ Single Premium - PVFB

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{72}$ Increasingly, pension providers purchase large group deferred life annuities to fund their pension plans. These are extremely large contracts made up of potentially many individual pension plan participants (e.g. employees), so it often makes sense to keep these in their own accounting cohort.
    ${ }^{73}$ More on this in a moment.

## Page 93
- Most appropriate amortization basis:discounted future benefits (PVFB)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Profit }_{0} & =\text { Prem }_{0}-\text { PVFB }_{0} \\
\text { DPL } \% & =\frac{\text { Profit }_{0}}{\text { PV(PVFB) }_{0}} \\
\text { DPL }_{t} & =\left(\text { DPL }_{t-1}-\text { DPL } \% \times \text { PVFB }_{t}\right) \times(1+i) \\
& =\text { DPL } \% \times \text { PV(PVFB) }_{t}
\end{aligned}
$$

$\operatorname{PV}(\mathrm{PVFB})_{t}=\mathrm{PV}$ of each future instance of $\mathrm{PVFB}_{t}$ and $\mathrm{PVFB}_{t}=\mathrm{PV}$ of future benefits for time $t, t+1, \ldots$

The video lesson contains an example that makes the DPL easier to understand.

- As with traditional LD life insurance, DPL assumptions = LFPB assumptions
* Revise/true-up DPL when assumptions change
- Never update the DPL discount rate (same as traditional LD)
- Identification of gross premium:
* Payouts directly issued by the insurer: GP = amount paid for the contract
* Life insurance settlements: GP = DB proceeds
* Annuitizations of deferred annuities: GP = cash value available to purchase the payout annuity
* Exercise of MRBs: GP = fair value of the MRB when it is derecognized
- Examples: exercise of GMIB or when the PHAB reaches zero on a GLWB ${ }^{74}$
- Complexities caused by cohort groupings
- In reality, cohorts will contain multiple contracts issued during the year
- This means receiving single premiums on different dates
- Technically, the cohort's deferred profit should be based on cohort-level NPR reflecting the timing of each premium collected in the cohort ${ }^{75}$

$$
\mathrm{NPR}=\frac{\text { Cohort's PVFB }}{\text { PV Cohort's Single Premiums }}
$$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{74}$ A bit more detail that is not provided by the source reading: GLWBs fund withdrawals from the PHAB until it's exhausted. Once the PHAB is gone, it's fundamentally a life payout annuity, and this is the point when the GLWB MRB is actually exercised for GAAP accounting purposes (even though the contractholder had to formally elect to start receiving withdrawals earlier than this date.)
    ${ }^{75}$ The denominator is taking the PV of single premiums received during the issue year, so we're not talking about a long time horizon for the premium PV, but clearly the PV of a premium received in month 1 of the issue year is different from a premium received in month 12, so it could be significant in some situations. It's not clear what the "anchor point" should be for the PV (BOY, mid-year, etc.). The authors don't address this, and it probably requires judgment.

## Page 94
- As each premium is received, the contract contributes deferred profit $=(1-\mathrm{NPR}) \times$ GP
* Add these to the total deferred profit capitalized and recalculate the cohort's DPL\%
- Possible simplification: aggregate GPs into a single premium received on an average date
* Avoids calculating an NPR and calculating contract-level deferred profit
* The actuary should ensure this produces results similar to a more precise calculation
- Amortization basis alternative: use benefits instead of discounted PVFB

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Profit }_{0} & =\text { Prem }_{0}-\text { PVFB }_{0} \\
\text { DPL } \% & =\frac{\text { Profit }_{0}}{\text { PVFB }_{0}} \\
\text { DPL }_{t} & =\text { DPL }_{t-1} \times(1+i)-\text { DPL } \% \times \text { Ben }_{t} \\
& =\text { DPL } \% \times \text { PVFB }_{t}
\end{aligned}
$$

Produces similar results for immediate annuities, but will not release any profit during the deferral period of a deferred payout (not desirable, so many feel it's inappropriate)
The video lesson also contains an example of this method to illustrate the difference with the other method.

# Acquisition Cost Treatment 

Identification of deferrable acquisition costs follows the same guidance as other contracts that fall under ASC 944 (Ch. 4)

The following considerations are unique to life-contingent payout annuities:

- When a payout annuity arises from any source, a new contract begins with its own DAC
- Deferrable expenses are based on deferrable costs incurred to establish the payout
- Payouts resulting from annuitization elections under other contracts give rise to little, if any, DAC
- Payouts sold directly by the insurer are more likely to have a DAC asset
- Expected term for DAC = expected future lifetime of annuitant
- Requires updating each valuation date as expected life changes due to assumptions
- For contracts sold on a group basis (institutional purchases), common practice is to amortize DAC over the individual annuitants' expected life, not the expected term of the group contract (i.e. unit of account $=$ individual contract)
- Possible amortization bases for group DAC:

## Page 95
- Policies inforce: simplest, but usually inappropriate since it doesn't reflect contract size
* Appropriate if contracts are homogenous in size, age, and mortality characteristics
- Initial premium: better choice than policy count because it reflects contract size (amount of expense deferred)
* Disadvantage for institutional contracts: requires allocation of group premium to individual contracts
- Initial or "normal" benefit amount: similar advantages as initial premium
* Disadvantage for institutional contracts: benefit amount may change over time on deferred pension plans
- Current benefit amount: addresses disadvantage of using initial benefit amount, but doesn't meet the definition of "constant-level" basis, so probably not appropriate

The authors of the chapter do not make a firm recommendation on any of the above choices, but it would seem that using initial premium or initial benefit amount is the best choice for typical individual payout annuities-and probably also group contracts even though group contracts require more work to allocate the premium or benefit amount to individual contracts, which are the true unit of account. Please see the video lesson for DAC examples.

# Considerations for Variable Payout Annuities 

The benefit payment for a variable payout annuity adjusts over time to reflect the performance of the underlying separate account assets

At issue, the annuitant chooses an expected long-term investment rate from a narrow range (e.g. $3 \%$ to $5 \%)$

- The initial payment is based on this rate, then the payment adjusts over time

Some designs allow the insurer to add/subtract assets based on mortality experience
Most variable payout annuities are classified as UL-type since the benefits are not fixed and guaranteed

- As with a UL contract, the LFPB $=$ PHAB
- Challenge: there is no explicit PHAB, so an implied PHAB must be determined
- Possible method: PHAB $=\mathrm{PV}$ expected benefits at the LT rate elected by the annuitant

Due to the variable nature of the benefit payments, the current benefit payment should not be used to amortize DAC

## Disclosures

Disclosure requirements generally align with traditional long-duration non-par insurance (Ch. 5)

## Page 96
Even though ASC 944 does not require a DPL rollforward, some insurers may choose to present it anyway for LC payout annuities since the DPL is relatively significant

Additional judgment may be needed for the ASC 944 requirement to present a disaggregated rollforward of net premiums for contracts without future premiums

# Examples 

The final section of Ch. 12 contains examples of how to calculate reserves, DAC, remeasurement losses, and profit for a life-contingent payout annuity. All of these concepts are covered in the examples in the video lesson. The video lesson also contains examples involving a payout annuity classified as an investment contract-something that the chapter describes but does not illustrate numerically (but is highly testable numerically).
