# LPM-121: Life and Annuity Nonforfeiture Practices 

Source Author: Richard E. Ostuw (2000)

## Overview of This Reading

This is a fairly concise study note on nonforfeiture methods in the U.S., but it briefly touches on practices in other countries, too

In the U.S., nonforfeiture laws have a significant impact on life and annuity product design because nonforfeiture laws require insurers to offer minimum values for cash values and related benefits

This study note does not get into the specifics of U.S. nonforfeiture law, but rather describes more of the general philosophy behind why nonforfeiture values exist

We will see how SNL works for life and annuity products in more practical terms in the next study note, LPM-171

## Key topics for the exam include:

- Retrospective vs. prospective methods
- Types of nonforfeiture options
- Nonforfeiture practices in the U.S. and other countries
- The nonforfeiture calculation plan approach
- "Miscellaneous" nonforfeiture issues

These would be good to know if you were asked to critique any of the products/features listed

## Overview of Nonforfeiture Practices

"Nonforfeiture" means that the policyholder receives something when they surrender their policy or stop paying premiums
I.e. they don't "forfeit" everything

The main purpose of nonforfeiture options is to pay the policyholder their fair share of the equity in the policy

Nonforfeiture values can be based on 2 primary views:

1. Retrospective - the accumulation of policyholder equity since policy issue based on actual experience
2. Prospective - the value of future benefits based on anticipated experience

- Persister approach - assumes policies only terminate from mortality or expiry
- Whole contract approach - reflects any policyholder option to terminate/convert the contract

These two views can be quite different depending on experience

## Page 4
For example, if mortality is trending higher, the PV of future benefits will be high, causing the prospective value to be higher than the retrospective value

More on these views in the sections that follow

# Definitions 

Fund - retrospective accumulation of credits and debits
Cash surrender value (CSV) - fund value less surrender charges
Surrender charges - amounts intended to cover the company's acquisition expenses

## Types of Nonforfeiture Options

These options are mentioned and sprinkled throughout the study note, but I've consolidated the main points here.

## 1. Cash Surrender

Policyholder receives the CSV of the policy

## 2. Extended Term Insurance (ETI)

Full policy face is kept in force as long as CSV can support it
CSV declines as the cost of insurance is deducted
If CSV falls to zero, the policy will terminate
Advantages of ETI:

- Maximizes policyholder's insurance protection
- ETI expenses lower since coverage period is less than RPU
- Making ETI the automatic (default) option can reduce antiselection

Disadvantage of ETI: higher antiselection than other options
If you know you're going to die soon, ETI is a great option since it maximizes your death benefit and allows you to stop paying premiums immediately

## 3. Reduced Paid-Up (RPU)

Policy face amount is reduced to the point where it is paid-up with the current cash value

$$
\mathrm{CSV}_{x}=(\text { RPU Face }) A_{x}
$$

Policy stays in force until maturity at the lower face amount (like a smaller WL policy)
Advantages of RPU:

- Keeps original form and expiry date intact
- Low antiselection

## Page 5
# 4. Automatic Premium Loan (APL) 

Premiums are paid by taking out loans against the policy's CSV
Each successive premium increases the outstanding policy loan balance
Advantages of APL:

- The face amount of the policy remains the same
- The policy stays in force as long as CSV $>$ Loan Balance
- Policyholder can repay the loan at anytime and/or resume making premium payments
- Special benefits and riders remain in force

Disadvantages of APL

- Policy loan activity will increases
- Provides incentive to stop paying premiums
- Policyholder loan interest may be high
- Death protection may be reduced by loan balance
- Cannot be exercised if no CSV


## 5. Annuitization

Deferred annuity contracts may let the policyholder annuitize the cash value

## 6. Flexible UL Premium Payments

A flexible premium UL policy does not require any premium payments as long as CSV $>0$
A flexible premium UL policy where the policyholder isn't paying any premiums is functionally like ETI

## Methods for Calculating Nonforfeiture Options

## 1. Retrospective Method

Accumulation of credits and debits:
Fund $_{t}=$ Fund $_{t-1}+$ Premiums $_{t}+$ Interest $_{t}-$ Benefit Charges $_{t}-$ Expenses $_{t}-$ Profit $_{t}$
Currently used for variable annuities in the U.S.
This approach is easy for policyholders to understand but can limit product design
"No lapse guarantee" products guarantee a positive fund value even if CSV $<0$
Found on some UL products where cash value is low relative to surrender charges in the early years

Prospective and retrospective methods may give very different results for no-lapse designs

## Page 6
# 2. Prospective Method 

Forward-looking view including all significant benefits, appropriate share of company expenses, and a reasonable contribution to profits:

PV Future Benefits + PV Expenses + PV Profits - PV Premiums
Assumptions may be specified by regulators

## Disadvantages/Challenges:

- Harder to explain to policyholders than the retrospective method

Especially if bad experience leads to lower values

- If policy classes are broadly defined, experience will not be homogenous within the class (i.e. will vary by gender and risk factors)
- Flexible premium products (UL) require an assumption about future premium payments
- Premium payments affect death benefits for certain products

Does a better job of maintaining parity between persisting and terminating policyholders since current values reflect expected future experience

## 3. Net Premium Method

Same as the prospective method, except use a level net premium calculated at issue:
PV Level Net Premiums $=$ PV Future Benefits + PV Acquisition Costs

The net premium is a constant percentage of gross premiums
This method is currently required in the U.S. for traditional policies
Regulators prescribe assumptions for mortality and interest as well as max level of acquisition expense

Like the prospective method, the actuary needs to make some kind of assumption about future premiums for flexible premium UL

May assume some percentage of premiums are paid ( $0-100 \%$ )

## 4. Single Premium Method

Assumes the policyholder "borrows" a single premium to purchase the policy
As the policyholder makes premium payments, the loan is reduced, and the policyholder gains equity

Very different from other approaches

## Nonforfeiture Practices in the U.S.

Net Premium Method required for traditional life
Retrospective required for UL

## Page 7
Required nonforfeiture values date back to the 19th century
Nonforfeiture options try to balance 2 socially desirable but competing objectives:

1. Keep cost of insurance as low as possible
2. Pay out policyholder's equity on surrender

# Different Views on Equity in the U.S. 

- Policyholder view - equitable sum of gross premiums with interest less a reasonable charge for cost of protection
- Company view - compensation for costs and reasonable profit for taking risk
- Agent view - reasonable reward for consummating a sale
- Regulator view - amount that maximizes policyholder's return but doesn't threaten the company's solvency

Other Factors Affecting Equity

- Who pays cost of early terminations? (remaining policyholders, company, agent)
- Expense allocation method


## Nonforfeiture Practices in Other Countries

## - Canada

No minimum nonforfeiture law for life insurance
Mutual companies must file their participating dividend policy with the Canadian regulator

## - South Africa

Only required for small funeral policies; otherwise none

## - Scandinavia

None required, but policyholders are informed about surrender terms

## - United Kingdom

None required
Most life products are variable life, where nonforfeiture values are tied to the MV of policyholder's assets
The U.K. also has strong disclosure regulation

## - Australia

None required, but might happen in the future

## Page 8
# The Nonforfeiture Calculation Plan 

A written plan describing the company's method for calculating nonforfeiture values if they aren't mandatory

- Nonguaranteed elements (mortality, dividends, etc.)
- Methodologies for determining experience
- How nonforfeiture values are determined for all durations
- Prospective vs. retrospective approach

More flexible than methods prescribed by regulation
The plan should be updated periodically
Corporate management has the ultimate responsibility for setting the plan
In the 1990s, there was a push to get the NAIC to adopt this more flexible plan approach, but it failed to get traction

## Miscellaneous Nonforfeiture Issues

- Actuary may need to adjust surrender values for withdrawals
- Disintermediation - high lapses when asset values are low
- How to account for expenses (e.g. use more conservative mortality rates)
- Substandard risks
- May charge higher premium but not change CSV
- Practical problems arise if policyholder later qualifies for reduced substandard rates
- Lack of nonforfeiture benefits may lead to very low lapses on certain policies (e.g. T100)

# LPM-171: Nonforfeiture and Other Benefits 

Source Author: Claire, Lombardi, and Summers (2018)

## Overview of This Reading

LPM-171 contains excerpts from two chapters in Statutory Valuation of ILA Contracts, which is a textbook that is covered in much more depth on the LFMU syllabus

The prior study note covered in the course (LPM-121) gave us a very generic introduction to the concept of nonforfeiture; LPM-171 covers material that is more specific to the actual SNL for WL and annuity contracts in the US

The Ch. 12 excerpts focus on WL contracts, while Ch. 18 focuses on annuity contracts

## Key topics for the exam include:

- Formula for the minimum CSV for life insurance under SNL
- Assumptions used in the prescribed SNL formula
- Policyholder dividend terminology
- Contribution principle
- Formula for the minimum CSV for annuities under SNL
- Annuity settlement options


## Ch. 12: Sections 12.2, 12.3, 12.4 Only

## Standard Nonforfeiture Law (SNL) for Life Insurance

It's worth emphasizing the SNL is an entirely different law than SVL. SNL prescribes minimum nonforfeiture values. However, SNL does reference the SVL and VM for the interest rate assumption.

SNL defines the minimum guaranteed cash surrender value and reduced paid-up insurance that an insurer can offer

## Minimum Cash Surrender Value

$$
\operatorname{MinCV}_{t}=\max \left[\mathrm{PVFB}_{t}-\mathrm{PVAdjPrem}_{t}, 0\right]
$$

## Page 10
where:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { AdjPrem } & =\text { adjusted premium for the first policy year } \\
& =\frac{\mathrm{EA}_{x}+\mathrm{PVFB}_{0}}{\bar{a}_{x}} \\
\mathrm{EA}_{x} & =0.01 \times \text { Face }+1.25 \times \min [0.04 \times \text { Face, NFNLP }] \\
\text { NFNLP } & =\text { nonforfeiture net level premium } \\
& =\frac{\mathrm{PVFB}_{0}}{\bar{a}_{x}}
\end{aligned}
$$

For a level face policy, just use the actual level face amount, but if the face amount is non-level, then use the average face amount over the first 10 years only

$$
\text { Face }=\frac{1}{10} \sum_{t=0}^{9} \text { Face }_{t}
$$

If you were perceptive, you noticed that the adjusted premium in the book is defined as "adjusted premium for the first policy year." This subtlety was probably included to generalize the formula for non-level premiums even though the authors never mention non-level GPs in this chapter. Just be aware that in reality, the SNL defines adjusted premiums as a level $\%$ of GPs, which means a more general approach would be:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { AdjPrem } \% & =\frac{\mathrm{EA}_{x}+\mathrm{PVFB}_{0}}{\mathrm{PVGP}_{0}} \\
\mathrm{PVAdjPrem}_{t} & =\text { AdjPrem } \% \times \mathrm{PVGP}_{t}
\end{aligned}
$$

# Mortality and Interest Assumptions for Minimum CSV 

- Mortality: use the prevailing CSO table at policy issue
- Maximum nonforfeiture interest rate
- For policies issued before the VM operative date: ${ }^{1}$
$i=125 \% \times$ maximum valuation interest rate under SVL rounded to nearest $0.25 \%$
- For policies issued on/after the VM operative date:

$$
i=\max [4 \%, 125 \% \times \text { CY stat valuation interest rate for the NPR }]
$$

## Reduced Paid-Up (RPU) Insurance

$$
\mathrm{RPU}_{x+t}=\frac{\operatorname{MinCSV}_{x+t}}{A_{x+t}}
$$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ The current SNL also places a $4 \%$ floor on the nonforfeiture interest rate for pre-operative date policies, but this study note does not mention it in their formula.

## Page 11
All PVs are calculated with the same mortality and interest as the minimum CSV

# Policyholder Dividends 

Life insurance policies that pay policyholder dividends are called participating policies ${ }^{2}$
Most participating policies are sold by mutual life insurance companies, which are insurance companies owned by their policyholders

- Contrast with a stock life insurance company, which is owned by shareholders ${ }^{3}$


## Dividend options offered to participating policyholders:

1. Receive the dividend in cash
2. Apply dividend to some or all of the next premium due
3. Deposit the dividend with the insurer to earn interest
4. Purchase paid-up additional (PUA) insurance coverage without evidence of insurability
5. Purchase one-year term (OYT) insurance without evidence of insurability

No. 4 is the most common

## Dividend Scale

Dividend scale - set of rates that details how divisible surplus will be distributed participating policies

Divisible surplus - aggregate amount of capital to be distributed as policy dividends
Division of surplus is at the sole discretion of the board, but they have a duty to be "fair and equitable"

The board is advised by a senior dividend actuary with extensive experience in determining policyholder dividends

## Duties of the dividend actuary when developing the dividend scale:

1. Review experience of the each dividend class: expense, policy loan, mortality and policy termination
2. Determine investment earnings of the assets supporting the participating policies: interest, dividends, capital gains/losses
[^0]
[^0]:    2 "Participating" means that the policyholder participates in the experience of the block by receiving a portion of the block's surplus as dividends over time. This is essentially a complicated "return of premium" mechanism because the surplus is generated by excess premiums that were not needed to pay for mortality, expenses, etc. This also means that participating policies will tend to charge higher premiums than non-participating.
    ${ }^{3}$ Stock life insurance companies can still issue participating life insurance within specific participating blocks of the company.

## Page 12
3. Determine amount of earnings from other lines of business that will be reflected in the dividend scale
4. Develop dividend factors for allocating divisible surplus to individual participating policies
5. Perform various analyses to confirm compliance with applicable law, ASOPs, and the insurer's dividend policy
6. Issue a report documenting the processes used in the development of the dividend scale Developing a dividend scale is a tedious, year-round process (takes a full CY to develop the scale for the next CY)

The board strives to strike a balance between:

1. Withholding enough surplus to absorb:

- Unexpected future losses
- Fund future growth of the company
- Maintain strong financial ratings

2. Distributing surplus to its owners (the participating policyholders who contributed to the surplus)

# Contribution Principle 

ASOP 15 requires the dividend actuary to use the contribution principle for determining dividends unless a different basis is preferable, reasonable, and appropriate based on the actuary's judgment

- Must be applied annually or over an extended period of time

Fundamental concept underlying the contribution principle: allocate divisible surplus to policies proportionally based on each policy's contribution

3-factor dividend formula - common formula for determining policyholder dividends

- Assumptions for expense, mortality, and interest are set at policy issue, and dividends arise based on 3 components ("factors"):

1. Expense factor - difference between assumed and actual expenses
2. Mortality factor - difference between assumed and actual mortality cost
3. Interest factor - difference between actual and assumed investment earnings

- Mortality and interest are usually the largest factors overall
- Mortality is the largest in early years
- The interest factor can become significant in later policy years when accumulated assets are much higher

## Page 13
- Factors are generally based on the experience of a group of policies but also vary based on age, gender, and policy year

The study note does not provide an explicit mathematical formula for dividends. It only explains it verbally as we have above. In the spreadsheet screenshots shown in the study note, the dividends simply "appear" in the output. Therefore, I don't think you will be expected to calculate dividends in an exam problem unless a problem provides a specific formula. I think it is better to understand conceptually how dividends arise and also how they can be used. Our video lesson further illustrates the reserve implications of dividends.

# Ch. 18: Sections 18.2, 18.3.2, 18.3.3 Only 

## Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Annuities

These sections cover the SNL for annuities: minimum guaranteed values that the insurer must provide (paid-up annuity benefits, CSVs, and DBs)

The value of any paid-up annuity benefit or CSV offered by the contract must be no less than the SNL minimum nonforfeiture value:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Min NF Amount }_{t}= & \left(\text { Min NF Amount }_{t-1}+(87.5 \%)\left(\text { Consideration }_{t}\right)-50-\text { PremTax }_{t}\right)(1+i) \\
& -\text { PartialWd }_{t}-\text { PolicyLoan }_{t}
\end{aligned}
$$

$i=$ minimum SNL Interest Rate $=5$-Year CMT $-1.25 \%$

- 5-Year CMT $=5$-year Constant Maturity Treasury reported by the Federal Reserve rounded to the nearest $0.05 \%$
- $i$ is capped at $3 \%$ and floored at $1 \%$
- Can subtract an additional 1\% for indexed annuities (EIAs)

$$
i=5 \text {-Year CMT }-2.25 \%
$$

- The $1 \%$ floor still applies

The minimum nonforfeiture amount above essentially regulates the amount of surrender charges the insurer can apply on surrender. As with UL, the CSV of the DA contract at any point in time is the current FV - surrender charges. This CSV can't be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount above.

## Settlement Options

Settlement option - the option to convert the accumulated value into some type of payout annuity

Most deferred annuities offer these common settlement options (i.e. types of payout or immediate annuities):

1. Annuity certain - makes periodic payments for a specified period of time even if the annuitant dies (not life contingent)

## Page 14
2. Straight-life annuity - makes periodic payments only while the annuitant is alive (life contingent)
3. Life annuity with a period certain - makes periodic payments for life but guarantees payments for a certain period (even if annuitant dies before end of certain period)
4. Refund annuity - a life annuity that makes additional payments on or after death

- Cash refund annuity - pays a lump sum payment $=\max (0$, Purchase Price $-\sum$ Annuity Payments Made Through Death)
- Installment refund annuity - continues making payments to a beneficiary after the annuitant's death until sum of all payments = purchase price

5. Joint and survivorship annuity - a life annuity on two annuitants that continues making payments to the survivor after one person dies (payments stop completely on 2nd death)

- Payment is usually reduced after first death however (e.g. $70 \%$ of original)

If the annuitant dies during the accumulation phase (i.e. before electing one of the above settlement options), the contract must provide a $\mathrm{DB} \geq$ minimum nonforfeiture value at the time of death

- Common practice is to waive any surrender charges and pay the full FV on death

## Page 15
# Overview of Nonguaranteed Elements (NGEs) 

Source Author: Cook, Koon, Motiwalla, and Rudolph (November 2022)

## Overview of This Reading

This paper covers life insurance products with nonguaranteed elements (NGEs), including key regulations and sources of professional guidance

Common examples of NGEs include credited rates, COI charges, etc. that can the insurer can adjust over time

Key topics for the exam include:

- History of NGE products and typical product designs
- Types of NGEs
- NGE determination and revision process
- Sources of professional guidance (ASOPs)
- US regulations affecting NGEs
- International regulation and considerations
- Practical issues


## Background and History of NGEs

## Principal characteristics of NGEs:

1. Affect the cost of contractual benefits and policy values
2. Not guaranteed except for minimum or maximum values
3. May be changed unilaterally by the insurer, subject to contractual/legal restrictions

Common NGEs: COI charges, expense loads, credited interest rates, index parameters, nonguaranteed bonuses, and indeterminate premiums

## NGEs do not include policyholder dividends ${ }^{4}$

- Policyholder dividends are paid on participating policies
- Policyholder dividends = par policyholders' share of a par block's profits

NGEs are mainly based on expectations of future experience, while dividends are based primarily on actual past experience

NGEs arose in response to problems and opportunities in the 1970s-1980s:

[^0]
[^0]:    4 This statement is very specific to ASOP 2 in the US. Standards of practice and laws in other countries often lump policyholder dividends into the "NGE" category. Other US ASOPs like ASOP 24 also consider policyholder dividends NGEs for illustration purposes. However, policyholder dividends are scoped out of ASOP 2 becuase ASOP 15 is devoted to policyholder dividend determination.

## Page 16
- Traditional guaranteed life/annuity product design lacked flexibility to adapt to rapidly changing conditions
- Interest rates and inflation were very high and volatile
- Mortality improved substantially, but pricing actuaries didn't know if it would continue
- Insurers were reluctant to price possibly temporary favorable experience changes into long-term guarantees
- Non-insurance accumulation products began offering higher credited rates
- Increased computer power made it possible to develop more sophisticated products

Initially, the partial elimination of guarantees resulted in lower pricing

# Most significant early NGE product designs: 

- Fixed deferred annuities with discretionary crediting rates, subject to guaranteed minimums
- UL with crediting rates, bonus elements, and charges, subject to contractual restraints
- Was said to "unbundle" the death protection and investment aspects of WL
- Early designs had unattractive expense charge structures but quickly changed to be more competitive
- Indeterminate premium plans with rates that could be changed after issue, subject to maximums

FDAs and UL products gave policyholders more flexibility over contract funding, and provided insurers more flexibility in setting credits/charges

## Primary sources of actuarial guidance on NGEs:

- ASOP 2: NGEs for Life Insurance And Annuity Products
- Life Insurance Illustrations Model Regulation
- Universal Life Insurance Model Regulation

Policyholders have brought class action lawsuits against insurers after NGE changes in the past:

- Changes that were not allowed by the contract
- Changes that calculated inappropriately
- Changes that recoup past losses


## Trend vs variance:

- Future changes to NGEs result from variances from expected values

## Page 17
- If NGEs already anticipate experience trends that play out according to expectations, no changes are needed


# NGE Types, Determination, and Revision 

## Types of NGEs

- Credited rates that are adjustable based on investment performance subject to guaranteed minimums
- Premium loads and other expenses subject to guaranteed maximums
- COI charges - vary by underwriting class, sex, attained age, issue age, and policy year
- Subject to guaranteed max rates set to comply with SNL and tax law
- Guaranteed rates may be higher if anticipated mortality $>$ nonforfeiture mortality
- Index parameters on FIA and IUL - cap rates and participation rates subject to guaranteed rates specified in the policy
- Nonguaranteed bonuses - credits to the AV or refund of charges under certain conditions
- VA rider charges for enhanced guaranteed living benefit riders, subject to max values specified in the policy
- Indeterminate premiums - traditional products with guaranteed and nonguaranteed premium scales


## Original NGE Determination

The pricing actuary must consider a product's purpose, market, buyer preferences, etc.
Considerations when balancing the insurer's profitability targets with consumer needs:

- Expected mortality
- Depends on underwriting, target market, risk classes, policy sizes, etc.
- COI charges relative to expected mortality
- Policy load and expense charges
- How to cover policy issue expenses
- Portion of the premium used to cover these costs
- Source of revenue for flexible premium products
- Basis for credited interest
- Whether investment yields will be sufficient to cover credited interest and other costs
- Use of new money vs. portfolio method for setting credited rates

## Page 18
Experience studies and sensitivity testing are important when pricing products with NGEs
Pricing is an iterative/holistic process

- As assumptions are modified, assess profitability/competitiveness individually and in aggregate


# Impacts of Revising NGEs 

Products with NGEs have lower premiums than fully guaranteed products, all else equal

- NGE policyholders bear more risk of lower benefits (or higher future premiums) if experience deteriorates

Insurers can provide illustrations of possible future values to policyholders
NGE revisions are allowed if experience doesn't align with anticipated experience factors (AEFs) set in the original pricing

## Professional Guidance Related to NGEs

## Actuarial Standards of Practice (ASOPs)

ASOPs are created by the Actuarial Standards Board (ASB) to provide guidance to US actuaries

## ASOP 2: NGEs for Life Insurance and Annuity Products

- Scope: individual life and annuity products with NGEs
- Applies to both initial and subsequent determination

Other ASOPs relevant to NGEs: ${ }^{5}$

- ASOP 12: Risk Classification
- ASOP 23: Data Quality
- ASOP 24: Compliance with the NAIC Life Insurance Illustrations Model Regulation
- ASOP 25: Credibility Procedures
- ASOP 41: Actuarial Communications
- ASOP 54: Pricing of Life Insurance and Annuity Products
- ASOP 56: Modeling


## General Practice (ASOP 2)

NGE Framework $=$ a combination of:

[^0]
[^0]:    5 Some of these are only listed by name in the paper, while some have more detail later upcoming sections of the paper. ASOP 2 gets the most attention in this paper since it's the primary ASOP for NGE determination in the US. ASOPs come and go on the syllabus year to year, so you may also encounter these elsewhere in the course in more detail.

## Page 19
- Company's determination policy
- Method used by the insurer to define a policy class
- Any other relevant criteria/principles used to determine NGEs

Determination policy = insurer's governing principles/objectives for determining NGEs

- Could be a single document or a collection of documents
- Includes profitability/capital objectives/requirements
- Specifies the frequency of NGE reviews with a maximum time period between reviews Policy classes $=$ policies that are grouped together when determining NGEs
- Different NGEs can have different class definitions but must appropriately reflect differences within anticipated experience factors ${ }^{6}$
- Classes are not expected to change after issue but can be redefined if supported by new information


# ASOP 2 Determination Process for Revising NGE Scales on Inforce Policies 

1. Review any prior determinations, including the original at product pricing

- If not available, use a reasonable approach to reconstruct
- Consider whether NGE scales are consistent with policy language

2. Analyze how experience is emerging relative to what was anticipated at the prior determination

- Remember that the expectation is not to revise unless anticipated experience factors change

3. Consider whether to recommend a revision to NGE scales

- Not purely a mathematical exercise (consider multiple criteria)
- Other stakeholders involved/affected: senior management, marketing, legal, admin teams

4. If doing a revision, determine the revised NGE scales

- Should be purely prospective: focus on future profitability levels
- Objective should NOT be to recoup past losses or distribute past gains


## Documentation

${ }^{6}$ We've tried to preserve the wording from the source reading here in case it appears in an exam problem, but it's difficult to understand. We think the authors may be trying to say that a policy can be assigned to multiple policy classes (e.g. one for credited interest and another for COI charges), which is true according to the actual ASOP.

## Page 20
- ASOP 2 provides guidance on documentation requirements ${ }^{7}$
- Even if an insurer elects not to revise NGE scales, the entire process for reaching that decision should be documented
- ASOP 41 applies to any actuarial communications, including documentation prepared for ASOP 2


# Data Considerations 

- ASOP 23 data considerations:
- Actuaries must review data (or disclose why they didn't)
* NOT required to audit data
- Disclose any limitations of the data and implications of limitations
- ASOP 2 data considerations:
- Use professional judgment if recreating past determinations
- Disclose any reliance on others
* Must still review the data and method/models that use the data
- ASOP 25 provides guidance on credibility considerations that may be relevant during the determination process


## Modeling Considerations

ASOP 56 provides guidance on modeling: designing, developing, selecting, modifying, using, reviewing, and evaluating models

Ideally, the actuary can start with the original or a past determination model, but these are not always available/usable

Many instead start with a model originally designed for another purpose and modify it

- Example: cash flow testing or asset adequacy analysis ${ }^{8}$
- Aspects of CFT modeling that may require modifications:
- May be done at an aggregate level with potential simplifications
- May include provisions for adverse deviation that are not appropriate for NGE determination

[^0]
[^0]:    7 The authors of this paper omit most of the details of ASOP 2's documentation requirements.
    ${ }^{8}$ CFT models are used to satisfy an annual US statutory requirement to assess the adequacy of an insurer's assets and stat reserves for solvency purposes.

## Page 21
# US Regulations Affecting NGEs 

Model 582 and ASOP 24 lay the regulatory framework for life insurance illustrations ${ }^{9}$ involving NGEs

- Model 582: NAIC Life Insurance Illustrations Model Regulation ${ }^{10}$
- ASOP 24 provides guidance on complying with Model 582


## Model 582

Model 582 applies to all contracts that the insurer chooses to market with illustrations except:

- Variable life insurance
- Annuities
- Credit life insurance
- Life insurance policies with no illustrated DBs exceeding 10 K


## Model 582 requirements:

- Basic illustration - sent to all applicants for policies marketed with an illustration Model 582 requires basic illustrations to include a numeric summary of DBs, policy values, and premium outlay under 3 bases:

1. Policy guarantees
2. Insurer's illustrated scale
3. Insurer's illustrated scale but with reduced NGEs ${ }^{11}$

- Illustrated NGEs should be based on the average of guaranteed values and the values in the illustrated scale
- Includes nonguaranteed credit rates, charges, etc.


## - Requirements for illustrated NGEs:

- Cannot be more favorable than the illustrated scale at any duration
* Do not project improvements to NGEs
* All NGEs must be clearly labeled as "nonguaranteed"
- Illustrated scale cannot be more favorable than the lesser of:
- The disciplined current scale (DCS)

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{9}$ An illustration is a projection of values provided to applicants/policyholders that shows how the policy should perform under specific circumstances set out in the illustration.
    ${ }^{10}$ Model regulations are created by the NAIC for insurance states to adopt into law. Because insurance is primarily regulated at the state level in the US, model regs help unify insurance laws across the US.
    ${ }^{11}$ The point is to create a more conservative projection of policy values. The averaging reduces credited rates and increases charges relative to the illustrated scale. This third base will result in an illustration that falls between the guaranteed and illustrated scale.

## Page 22
- The currently payable scale ${ }^{12}$
- DCS = a scale based on the insurer's recent historical experience
- Developed/certified by an Illustration Actuary (IA)
- Must be consistent with the provisions of Model 582
- Must reflect only insurer actions that have already been taken
- Can not include any projected improvements in experience
- Expense assumptions can't be less than the minimum expenses defined in Model 582
- Model 582 points to ASOP 24 for guidance on actuarial work and certifications of the Illustration Actuary
- ASOP 24 defines parameters of the DCS (NGE scale) certified annually by the IA
- The DCS must also pass a self-support test (SST)
- The SST is passed if at every illustrated point on the 15th anniversary and later, accumulated policy cash flows $\geq$ illustrated $\mathrm{CSV}^{13}$
- Cash flows are based on DCS assumptions
- For second-to-die policies, test the 20th anniversary and later
- Lapse-supported illustrations are not allowed
- The IA must certify that illustrations are not lapse-supported based on a lapse support test
- Lapse support test is based on the SST with a modified lapse assumption:
* Years 1-5: use the same lapse rates as SST
* Years 6 and beyond: assume 100\% persistency ( $0 \%$ lapses)

Other model regs may be "peripheral" to an actuaries work in NGE determination:

- Model 235: Interest-Indexed Annuity Contracts Model Regulation
- Model 250: VA Model Regulation
- Model 270: Variable Life Insurance Model Regulation
- Model 580: Life Insurance Disclosure Model Regulation
- Model 585: UL Insurance Model Regulation

Most of the model regs above cover US statutory reserve requirements

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{12}$ This is the current/actual NGE scale in place.
    ${ }^{13}$ As the name of the test suggests, this tests to see if the policy can support itself without additional money from other sources under the assumptions in the DCS. This is also an application of the "asset share" method, which may appear in other source readings in other contexts. The accumulated policy CFs represent assets created by the policy at different points in time.

## Page 23
- Formulaic reserve methods often form the basis of policy guarantees and floor the stat reserve amount
- PBRs and GAAP methods may result in reserves above the floor
- NGEs are based on the company's NGE policies, experience assumptions, and varying margin levels ${ }^{14}$


# New York Regulation 210 

- Effective March 2018 for policies issued in NY (inforce and new business)
- More prescriptive (strict) than ASOP 2
- Key requirements of NY Reg 210:
- Max time between NGE reviews can't exceed 5 years
- Formally documented and board-approved NGE determination policy
- Various specific reinsurance considerations
- Waiting period for filings and disclosures to policyholders


## International Considerations

## Canadian NGE Regulation

Sources of regulation:

- OSFI promulgations ${ }^{15}$
- Insurance Companies Act (ICA)


## ICA Requirements Related to NGEs: ${ }^{16}$

- Sets expectations for the company's board regarding participating/adjustable policies
- Sets requirements for insurers:
- Establish a policy for determining dividends and bonuses
- Must have criteria for changing premiums/charges/benefits for adjustable policies
- Maintain separate accounts for par policies ("participating accounts")
- Duties of the actuary: report annually to the board on the continuing fairness of:

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{14}$ The authors seem to be pointing out that you can still project NGEs on policies subject to more sophisticated statutory reserve requirements.
    ${ }^{15}$ The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) is the primary regulator of financial institutions, including insurance companies, in Canada.
    ${ }^{16}$ It's perhaps worth noting that in Canada, NGE and dividend regulation is covered by the same regulation in the ICA, while in the US, Model 582 and ASOP 2 deal only with NGEs and not policyholder dividends.

## Page 24
- The board's participating policy management
- The board's criteria for adjustable policyholders


# CIA education note: "Guidance on Fairness Opinions Required Under the ICA Pursuant to Bill C-57" 

- Establishes general fairness principles that balance the interests of policyholders and the insurer:
- Establishing experience factor classes at issue
- Applying policies consistently over time
- Methods should be based on objective quantifications
- Dividends and adjustable policy changes should be consistent with the provisions of the policy and with the policies and criteria established by the board
- Avoid pooling experience beyond reasonable policyholder expectations or arbitrary cross-subsidization across classes
- Requires documentation in support of the actuary's fairness opinions
- Document areas/impact of judgment used to apply the insurer's policies


## Asian NGE Regulation

- Main NGEs in Asia: bonuses, par dividends, UL crediting rates
- Others: COI charges on unit-linked ${ }^{17}$ and UL products; premium rates on critical illness term riders


## - Singapore NGE regulation

- Monetary Authority of Singapore Notice 320: Management of Participating Life Insurance Business
* Requires internal governance policy/controls for allocation of charges and expenses
* Requires disclosures related to participating life insurance
* Sets roles/responsibilities of the board, senior management, and appointed actuary
- Singapore Actuarial Society Standard of Actuarial Practice L03 for Appointed Actuaries on Participating Fund Management for Life Insurance Business
* Issued to supplement Notice 320
* Provides guidance on establishing/managing a policy for the fund

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{17}$ Unit-linked products are more common outside of North America. Unit-linked life insurance is somewhat like variable life insurance in the US, but there are differences in how the benefits and guarantees work (things that are not covered on the syllabus).

## Page 25
* Gives each company discretion on how to implement the policy in practice


# - Hong Kong NGE regulation 

- Guideline 16: Underwriting Long Term Insurance Business (Other than Class C Business)
* Sets requirements for the fair treatment of customers
* Appointed Actuary must advise the board on policyholders' reasonable expectations when determining NGEs
* Does not prescribe an approach for NGE determination
* Class C (unit-linked) business is covered under a different guideline
- "Green light process" for unit-linked product approval
* Issued by the Hong Kong Insurance Authority and Securities and Futures Commission
* Strengthens governance/disclosure
* Ensures consideration of the "principle of treating customers fairly"
* Insurers must benchmark charges (COI, etc.) to other alternatives in the market for comparison
- Japan NGE regulation
- No formal ASOPs specific to NGEs
- One ASOP requires the appointed actuary to confirm that annual policyholder dividends are adequately funded


## United Kingdom

- Most current NGE regulation was created in the early 2000s
- Primary focus: "TCF principle" (treat customers fairly)
- Requires communication/disclosures to policyholders around NGE determination
- Principles and Practices of Financial Management (PPFM) document
- Published by UK insurers that have with-profits (participating) business
- Requirements are set out in the Financial Conduct Authority's Conduct of Business Sourcebook
- Describes how NGEs are managed
- Detail varies by insurer but is generally high-level
- Can be amended at any time with written notice to policyholders

# Common Practical Issues When Revising NGE Scales 

- Original product pricing is often unavailable or not sufficiently detailed
- If unavailable, ASOP 2 instructs actuaries to select/document a reasonable approach to reconstructing
- ASOP 2 NGE Framework
- Serves as a guide for evaluating blocks and making necessary NGE revisions
- Form can be company-specific (not specified by ASOP 2)
- Experience data considerations/challenges
- Whether existing experience studies have sufficient granularity
- Credibility of experience
- Whether anticipated experience factors are supported by emerging experience
- Materiality of experience changes
- Sensitivity of profit to assumption changes
- Availability of policyholder behavior experience (premium persistency, lapse, etc.)
- No industry standard for evaluating changes in NGE anticipated experience factors
- ASOP 2 provides guidance but is "far from prescriptive"
- NGE scale revision practices vary by company
- Insurers who revise NGE scales have faced litigation and inconsistent case law
- ASOP 2 recommends avoiding a material increase in the prospective pattern of future profits by duration when revising NGE scales
* I.e. changing NGE scales should not increase expected profit relative to original profit expectations at issue
- Insurers may face litigation no matter what
- Potential litigation may discourage insurers from revising NGE scales
- However, insurers have also faced litigation for not revising scales
- Implementation challenges
- Limitations of older legacy admin systems
- Extra staffing required to prepare rates, notify policyholders, and produce illustrations
- ASOP 2 allows the actuary to consider implementation cost/practicality when deciding to make revisions
- Communication helps the process go more smoothly

## Page 27
- Communicate consistently with policyholders and agents around annual statements, illustrations, etc.


# - Establish a repeatable process for reviewing NGE scales 

## Case Study

This paper's final section outlines a hypothetical review of "Company ABC's" UL business. There is no new information here relative to the main body of the paper, but it provides examples of how an actuary might critique an existing NGE framework and recommend changes. It also contains some sample wording from hypothetical policy forms, etc. Skimming over this case study to reinforce concepts from the main body. An exam question might give you information from a hypothetical NGE framework and ask you to critique it similarly and recommend changes based on the concepts covered in the main body of the paperespecially those related to ASOPs and country-specific regulations.

# ASOP 24: NAIC Life Insurance Illustrations Model Reg 

Source Author: Actuarial Standards Board (December 2016)

## Overview of This Reading

ASOP 24 provides guidance to actuaries on compliance with the NAIC Life Insurance Illustrations Model Regulation ("the Model")

The Model is the law adopted by states to govern life insurance illustrations ${ }^{18}$

## Key topics for the exam include:

- Purpose, scope, and effective date
- Definitions of key terms
- Analysis of issues and recommended practices
- Regulatory requirements
- Appointment as illustration actuary
- Illustrated scale requirements
- Considerations when developing the DCS
- Requirements for self-support
- Requirements to prevent lapse-supported illustrations
- Illustrations on policies in force one year or more
- Changes in practice
- Reliance on data or other information supplied by others
- Documentation
- Communications and Disclosures


## Purpose, Scope, and Effective Date

Purpose: provide guidance to actuaries when performing professional services pursuant to the Model

ASOP 24 Scope: all actuarial services related to the Model
Model scope: illustrations for all group and individual life insurance excluding:

- Variable life
- Policies without illustrated DBs exceeding 10,000

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{18}$ This is the same law as "Model 582" in the "Overview of NGEs" reading covered earlier in the course. ASOP 24 never uses the phrase "Model 582" and simply calls it the "Model" for short.

## Page 29
AG 49 also relates to the Model and provides guidance for IUL illustrations ${ }^{19}$
Also not in scope of ASOP 24:

- Determination of nonguaranteed elements (NGEs) (ASOP 2) ${ }^{20}$
- Determination of policyholder dividends (ASOP 15)

Even though the determination of NGEs and policyholder dividends is outside the scope of ASOP 24, illustration of both of them is within the scope of ASOP 24.

Effective date: $4 / 30 / 2017$

# Definitions 

- Actual Experience - historical results/trends
- Currently payable scale (CPS) - NGE scale effective within 95 days of illustration date Disciplined current scale (DCS) - NGE scale that places a limit on what the insurer can illustrate
- Based on actual recent historical experience
- Certified annually by the illustration actuary
- Experience factor - value(s) that represent the actual experience of a policy form
- Examples: rates of mortality, expense, investment income, termination, and taxes
- Experience Factor Class - a group of policies that have one or more experience factors determined in common
- Illustrated Scale - the scale of NGEs currently being illustrated
- Cannot be more favorable to the policyholder than min[DCS, CPS]
- Illustration Actuary - appointed based on requirements in the Model
- Nonguaranteed Element (NGE) - any policy element that affects policy costs/values that is not guaranteed or not determined at issue
- NGEs after issue may be more favorable value to the policyholder than those guaranteed at issue
- Examples: policy dividends, ${ }^{21}$ excess interest credits, mortality charges, expense charges, indeterminate premiums, and indexed life insurance parameters

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{19}$ ASOP 24 references AG 49 in several places, but it's never described in any detail within ASOP 24. AG 49 provides guidance specifically for the illustration of life insurance products with index-based interest (IUL). It prescribes a detailed procedure to determine the max index credit for IUL illustrations. You'll see a little more detail later in the course on AG 49. In the context of ASOP 24, however, just understand that illustration law for IUL is essentially the Model + AG 49.
    ${ }^{20}$ ASOP 24 deals with the illustration of NGEs, but not determination.
    ${ }^{21}$ Even though policyholder dividends are outside of the scope of ASOP 2 (NGE determination), they are in scope of ASOP 24 for illustration purposes and considered to be NGEs in the context of ASOP 24.

## Page 30
- NGE Framework - The structure by which the insurer determines NGEs
- Based on the dividend framework in ASOP 15 or the NGE framework in ASOP 2
- Includes:
* Assignment of policies to experience factor classes
* Allocation method for income and costs
* Formulas or other methods related to experience factors


# Analysis of Issues and Recommended Practices 

Each of these are requirements that the actuary should follow, satisfy, comply with, etc.

## Regulatory Requirements

Be familiar with the Model, AG 49, any applicable state law based on the Model, and ASOP 24

## Appointment as Illustration Actuary

The IA must meet the Qualification Standards for Actuaries Issuing Statements of Actuarial Opinion in the US

- Appointment and acceptance/withdrawal should be in writing
- Describe the scope of the IA's responsibilities
- Establish the effective date


## Illustrated Scale Requirements

Ensure that the illustrated scale meets the Model's requirements:

- Cannot be more favorable to the policyholder than the CPS or DCS at any duration
- IUL: illustrated interest credits should be limited in accordance with AG 49


## Considerations when Developing the DCS

- Assumptions Underlying the DCS
- Use actual experience to the extent it is determinable, available, and credible
- Otherwise, use actual experience from similar classes (in order of preference):
* From the same company
* From other companies
* From other sources
- Refer to ASOP 25 for credibility guidance

## Page 31
- The DCS may not assume trends of improvement beyond the effective date of the illustrated scale


# - Assumption considerations: 

## - Investment return

* Should be reasonably based on recent actual investment experience net of defaults
* Index credits: reflect business/economic cycles appropriately and comply with AG 49
* Allocate using a reasonable method (e.g. portfolio, segmentation, investment generation)
* Investment expenses can be netted out of investment factors or treated separately
* Reflect the insurer's actual practice investment-related items (e.g. realized/unrealized capital gains/losses, hedges, policy loans)


## - Mortality and persistency

* Should be based on the insurer's actual experience if credible
* Variations to consider: age, gender, duration, marketing method, plan, policy size, risk class
* If company experience lacks credibility, use industry experience and/or professional judgment with other sources (e.g. general population mortality)


## - Direct sales expenses

* Reflect agent commissions, overrides, and other compensation resulting from sales
- All other expenses (i.e. not direct sales) should be based on one of the following approaches described in the Model:

1. Fully allocated - unit expenses reflect the group's direct expenses plus indirect expenses (overhead) allocated to the group
2. Marginal expenses - unit expenses reflect only the group's direct expenses (exclude overhead)

* Can use only if $\geq$ GRET

3. Generally recognized expense table (GRET) - unit expenses based on an industry expense study

* Can only be used if a GRET is available
* If no GRET is available, fully allocated must be used

The same unit expense basis must be used for all policy forms

## - Taxes

## Page 32
* Recognize all applicable tax cash flows
* Income taxes: recognize by duration
* Investment taxes: deduct from assumed investment return or treat separately
* Other taxes: handle separately or include in "all other expenses"
- Changes in methodology
* Modify the DCS to reflect methodology changes (e.g. change from portfolio to new money rate)
- Other lines of business
* If other LOBs are investments in the illustrated block, recognize cash flows appropriately
* Consider time horizon, investor relationship, and insurer's actual practice
- Relationship of Actual Experience to DCS
- Assumptions should logically and reasonably relate to actual experience in the NGE framework
- Reflect experience changes that are significant and ongoing
- Any observed improvement may not be reflected beyond the DCS effective date
- Reflect any significant deterioration in experience after the study date if expected to continue
- Aggregate experience should be unchanged after a change in underwriting as long as the insured population is not expected to change ${ }^{22}$


# Requirements for Self-Support 

Per the Model, all illustrated policies that have been inforce $<1$ year must be self-supporting
Self-Support Test (SST) - to pass, accumulated cash flows must be $\geq$ CSV each year starting in year 15 (or on expiration date if sooner)

- Second-to-die business: use year 20+
- Test assumptions $=$ DCS
- The actuary can choose to test policy forms in aggregate ${ }^{23}$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{22}$ It's hard to express this point concisely, but the key point is that if the insured population (in aggregate) is expected to be the same after an underwriting change occurs, aggregate experience should be unchanged even after you carve up the study into the new risk classes, etc.
    ${ }^{23}$ In other words, you don't have to test each individual policy. You can test all policies in aggregate that are associated with a particular policy form, but you have to make sure the aggregate assumptions are weighted appropriately based on the distribution of the business within the policy form (M/F, SM/NS, policy size, etc.).

## Page 33
- Assumptions should reflect the actual distribution of underwriting class and policyholder choices
- IUL: follow any additional limitations imposed by AG 49


# Requirements to Prevent Lapse-Supported Illustrations 

The Model prohibits the illustration of NGEs for lapse-supported policies
Lapse-Support Test (LST) - follow the same procedure as the SST, but with a modified persistency assumption:

- Years 1-5: use DCS lapses
- Years 6+: assume 0\% lapse rate

For policies with benefits contingent on premium continuation, consider whether all policies inforce at EOY 5 will qualify for such benefits

- Otherwise, assume all policies inforce at EOY 5 will receive their benefits

Policies that will never have nonforfeiture values are exempt from the LST

## Illustrations on Policies In Force One Year or More

As stated earlier, the illustrated scale must be no more favorable than min[DCS, CPS], and the IA must annually certify the DCS

The DCS for an inforce policy continues to be in compliance with the Model if any of the following apply since the prior CPS certification date:

1. CPS has not changed and experience does not warrant making the DCS significantly less favorable
2. CPS has been changed, but the changes are consistent with recent changes to the DCS
3. CPS has been made less favorable and more so than experience would dictate

If none of the 3 conditions apply, the IA should:

1. Review DCS experience factors and revise if necessary
2. Develop a new DCS for the policy form

The IA should consider including any distributions of accumulated surplus (e.g. for a closed block) in the DCS, illustrated scale, SST, and LST only if:

1. The distributions are currently being paid to policyholders
2. The insurer has the intent/ability to continue paying the distributions

## Changes in Practice

The insurer may change a business practice that will have a positive/negative effect on future experience

## Page 34
- Change in underwriting standard (e.g. introduction of preferred class)
- Change in commissions
- Staff reduction
- Change in investment policy
- New/revised reinsurance agreements

The IA should consider recognizing such changes in the DCS even before they impact actual experience (provided the change has already occurred)

# Reliance on Data or Other Information Supplied by Others 

Refer to ASOP 23: Data Quality

## Documentation

Comply with ASOP 41 (Actuarial Communications), and include the following:

- Description/rationale for assumptions: investment income, mortality, persistency, expense, tax, etc.
- Description/rationale for any calculation methods/assumptions used to carry ASOP 24 tests
- Demonstration that the SST and LST have been met


## Communications and Disclosures

- Certification - the IA must annually certify that the illustrated scale and DCS comply with the Model and ASOP 24
- Also certify any new policy forms introduced
- Certification should disclose:
* Business issued in the last 5 years: whether the CPS has been reduced since the last certification for reasons unrelated to experience changes
* Choice of expense assumptions (fully allocated, marginal, GRET)
* Any inconsistencies between new and similar inforce policies related to:
- Illustrated NGEs
- Illustrated NGEs relative to NGEs actually paid/credited/charged
- The IA should notify the board and commissioner if unable to certify the illustrated scale
- Notice of Error in Certification
- The IA should notify the board and commissioner when discovering any errors in previous certifications

## Page 35
- "Error" means the certification would not have been issued or would have been materially altered
- Data/information that becomes available after a certification does not result in an error


# - Disclosures Under ASOP 41 

- Any material assumption/method prescribed by applicable law
- Reliance on other sources and disclaimer of responsibility for any material assumption/method selected by another party
- Any material deviations made from the guidance in this ASOP


## Appendix 1: Background and Current Practices

This appendix contains mostly historical information and is probably not very testable.

## 3 primary uses of illustrations:

1. Show the mechanics of the policy and how policy values/premiums may change over time
2. Compare the cost/performance of different policies
3. Show how the policy fits into the policyholder's financial plan

NGEs have become increasingly popular since the 1980s, and advances in computer technology have made it possible to provide a greater variety of illustrations

The original Model was developed in 1995
AG 49 was created in response to the growing number of index-based products (IUL) that have been introduced

## Appendix 2: Comments on Exposure Draft and Responses

This appendix contains various comments made by reviewers during the last exposure draft of ASOP 24. Feel free to skim it in ASOP 24, but it is unlikely to be tested.

Source Author: Richard Hoffer, Katie van Ryn, and Alexander Tall, Product Matters! (June 2023)

## Overview of This Reading

AG 49 was created in the 2010s to prescribe a maximum index credited rate that can be used for indexed UL (IUL) illustrations, as well as specify additional regulations for IUL beyond those in the Life Insurance Illustrations Model Reg

This brief article provides a brief history of AG 49 leading up to the most recent update to AG 49
This is a very brief article-almost too brief for exam purposes because the details are so sparse. Currently, this article is the only material source of AG 49 information on the syllabus. We've added additional commentary/footnotes to provide clarity in some places, but it is impossible to fully describe the product design complexity associated with the AG 49 without adding a lot of off-syllabus information. For exam purposes, you should only need to have a very basic understanding of AG 49 and its revisions as described by this article.

The video lesson for this reading walks through a reformatted version of the example shown in the source reading. We recommend being familiar with that example for exam purposes.

## Pre-AG 49

In 1995, the NAIC created the Life Insurance Illustrations Model Regulation ("Reg \#582") ${ }^{24}$

- Created illustration requirements for existing life insurance products (in general)
- Did not address product-specific illustration requirements


## IUL was created in 1997

- No official guidance on illustrating index-based accounts
- Insurers created inconsistent IUL illustrations


## 2015: AG 49 Created

By 2015, IUL was offered by an increasing number of carriers
Inconsistent illustrations resulted from lack of guidance and over-reliance on actuarial judgment ${ }^{25}$

## AG 49 was adopted to increase IUL illustration consistency

- Defined a max illustrated index credited rate based on a back-casting formula using the BIA

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{24}$ Other syllabus readings may refer to this as "Model 582"
    ${ }^{25}$ Even though there is some uncertainty in the future credited rate of a regular UL policy, there is much more uncertainty in an IUL policy's future index credits, which are affected by index performance and adjustable index parameters like caps, participation rates, etc.

## Page 37
- BIA $=$ Benchmark Index Account $^{26}$
- 1-year PTP index account based on the S\&P 500
- $100 \%$ participation and $0 \%$ floor
- Limited participating policy loan spread to 100 bps
- Limits assumed earned rate to $145 \%$ of net investment income rate
- Outlines additional required disclosures


# 2020: AG 49-A 

After 2015, insurers found ways to create more "appealing" illustrations

- Insurers began offering cap buy-ups and index multipliers in exchange for an account value charge (e.g. $5 \%)^{27}$
- Leverage $=$ index credits in excess of hedge cost
- BIA Illustrated Rate $=$ Option Budget + Leverage
- Multiplier Design Illustrated Rate $=$ Option Budget + Leverage $\times$ Multiplier
- Products became more complex; illustrations remained inconsistent

AG 49-A was created to mandate that multipliers or other enhancements cannot result in better illustrations

- I.e must assume multiplier $=1.0$ in the illustrated rate formula
- Max Illustrated Rate $=$ BIA Illustrated Rate
- Also reduced the spread on participating loans to $50 \mathrm{bps}^{28}$


## 2023: AG 49-A Quick-Fix

Even after AG 49-A, insurers continued finding ways to outperform the BIA
Volatility control funds allowed for lower hedge costs and fixed bonuses

- Volatility-controlled indexes have lower volatility than the S\&P 500 assumed by the BIA (cheaper to hedge) ${ }^{29}$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{26}$ The source reading omits an important detail about the BIA: it also assumes the same cap as the actual product.
    ${ }^{27}$ The source reading doesn't fully explain how these features work, but they allowed the insurer to offer higher caps and/or credit bonus interest on top of the normal index credit for a fee. It was simply a way of gaming AG 49 to show a higher illustrated credited rate to make IUL policies more attractive to prospective buyers.
    ${ }^{28}$ The source reading doesn't explain the point of this, but it was done to limit how much loan leverage insurers could illustrate (i.e. situations where the policy loan rate < illustrated credits). This is a different "leverage" concept than the leverage related to index credits in excess of hedge costs.
    ${ }^{29}$ The BIA uses the S\&P 500 regardless, but AG 49 allowed the insurer to reflect the actual index if different from the S\&P 500, so this move exploited that loophole.

## Page 38
- Hedge savings are passed to IUL policyholders through fixed bonuses, which enhance illustrations
- Vol-Control Illustrated Rate $=$ Option Budget + Leverage + Fixed Bonus
- Products became even more complex and confusing to consumers

AG 49-A "Quick-Fix" (aka "AG 49-B"): max illustrated option profit can't exceed BIA profit

- Max Illustrated Credit $=$ Option Budget $\times \frac{\text { BIA Illustrated Rate }}{\text { BIA Option Budget }}+$ Fixed Bonus

The article closes by saying that there will likely be even more revisions to AG 49 in the future. Since "the future" is any date beyond the 2023 date of this reading, it's possible you will have already seen some of these revisions in practice, but it's important to stick with the detail in this reading for exam purposes even if it conflicts with newer developments in the real world.

# LPM-172: Guideline G6 - Illustrations 

Source Author: CLHIA (2008)

## Overview of This Reading

This guideline was authored by The Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association (CHLIA), an organization that seeks to balance the interests of consumers and Canadian insurers and promote best practices in Canada

This guideline is similar in purpose to illustration regulation in the US, although CHLIA guidelines are not technically laws: they are more like guidelines for best practices

## Key topics for the exam include:

- Key definitions
- Guaranteed vs. nonguaranteed policy features
- Required disclosures for interest rates linked to market performance
- Requirements for illustration scenarios
- Presentation of cash surrender values
- Tax-related disclosures
- Supplementary illustrations vs. complete illustrations


## Introduction and Purpose

## Guiding principles from CLHIA's Consumer Code of Ethics:

- Ensure that illustrations are clear/fair and contain appropriate disclosure of nonguaranteed amounts
- Advertise products/services clearly and avoid practices that might mislead


## Purpose of Guideline G6:

- Set out practices for point-of-sale and inforce illustrations
- Clear disclosure of guaranteed vs. nonguaranteed amounts
- Disclosure of circumstances that cause nonguaranteed values to vary


## Definitions

Guaranteed - values or features that cannot be modified/withdrawn by insurer; independent of future experience

Illustration - any communication of future policy values/features to a current or prospective client

Living benefits - critical illness, LTC, disability, etc.

## Page 40
Primary scenario - a scenario based on reasonable assumptions (interest rates, etc.)
Significant effect - a change in the policy that would likely influence a policyholder's decision

- Can be based on policy factors (e.g. loans, dividends) or experience factors (e.g. market rates, tax rates)

Supplementary illustration - shows a sales concept or strategy to a client based on a specific application of the insurance (e.g. demonstrate tax consequences)

# Scope 

This guideline applies to point-of-sale and inforce illustrations for life insurance policies and riders

Not in scope: annuities or group insurance
If this guideline conflicts with any laws, the laws take precedence

## Purpose of an Illustration

Primary purpose: Inform the client about policy features and operations
Not predictive unless based on guaranteed values

## Terminology and Presentation

Illustrations should be understandable and consumer-friendly
If form or content is abbreviated, inform the client about incompleteness and indicate where they can learn more

Avoid likely sources of confusion, like references to:

- "Compound interest"
- Terms that have a unique insurance meaning (e.g. "dividends")

Keep in mind that inforce policyholders may have forgotten details or changed expectations since the policy was issued

## Guaranteed vs. Nonguaranteed

Clarify which policy features are guaranteed and which are not
For nonguaranteed elements, clearly disclose that actual results may vary
Identify nonguaranteed factors that will have a significant effect and how they will impact policy features

If all amounts are guaranteed, the illustration should so state
Be clear that the illustration is not an exhaustive list of possible future scenarios

## Page 41
- Avoid giving the impression that a scenario is a worst-case


# Inforce Illustrations 

Reflect the current status of policy
Include all significant effects since purchase

## Interest Rates Linked to Market Performance

Primary scenario rates should reflect long-term performance
Interest rates can be gross or net of expenses, but should be used and disclosed consistently
Additional disclosures:

- Whether interest rate is based on price or total return
- Bonuses - nature of and any requirements to receive
- All applicable fees affecting policy credits
- Current and maximum guaranteed fees
- Nonguaranteed fees that may increase
- Tell clients where to find more information on historical rates of return and volatility
- Any credited rates determined by the insurer, including the formula and guaranteed minimum


## Illustration Scenarios: Life vs. Living Benefits

For either one, the company should provide at least 2 scenarios to show sensitivity to variations in experience

- Life Illustrations
- Nonguaranteed require at least 2 scenarios
- Primary scenario should be reasonable
- Second scenario should be less favorable
- Additional alternative scenarios are allowed if they increase consumer understanding
- Outline basis and assumptions for each scenario
- Apply key assumptions consistently by scenario
- Scenarios should be identified at least annually and updated in a reasonable period of time
- Living Benefit Illustrations

## Page 42
- Describe variability of features
- Alternative scenarios: same requirements as life illustrations apply


# Time Value of Money 

Values in the future should be appropriately discounted with interest

## Availability of Cash Values and Dividends

Indicate earliest year of positive CSVs (if any)
Indicate whether CSVs are guaranteed
If CSVs are reduced to zero in the future, show that point
Surrender charges can be shown explicitly or by showing the cash surrender value net of SCS
Indicate other significant dates (e.g. date of lapse or date of exempt test failure)
Show the impact of any policy loan effects

## Return of Premium

Disclose any contingencies on receiving ROP, when it becomes available, and other applicable values

## Tax-Related Disclosures

Indicate whether the policy could fail exempt testing (qualification as life insurance for Canadian tax purposes)

State that the illustration:

- Is based on an interpretation of tax law
- Does not constitute legal or tax advice
- May be different than actual tax results depending on the individual's personal circumstances


## Partial Illustrations

Be clear that partial illustrations are not complete illustrations

## Supplementary Illustrations

Intended to provide additional information about values taken from a complete illustration Supplementary illustrations are not required to fully satisfy this guideline (only the "spirit")

## Page 43
Include a prominent warning that the "presentation" is incomplete without the corresponding complete illustration(s)

Clearly disclose the structure and intent of the sales strategy
Use comparable cash flows when comparing insurance with alternate investments
Use reasonable rates for collateral loans (if used) and describe risks and implications:

- Risk that loan rate will be greater than what was assumed
- Risk of loan being called before the time assumed
- Implications of insured living beyond assumed life expectancy
- Implications of the loan/CSV ratio being larger than assumed


# Additional Identifications 

Each illustration should clearly identify:

- Preparation date
- Person for whom it was prepared
- Insurer providing the illustration

Point-of-sale illustrations should also identify:

- Advisor or agent
- Essential characteristics affecting illustrated results (age, gender, risk class, etc.)

In-force illustrations should also identify any additional key characteristics (policy number, issue date, etc.)

## Overview of This Reading

This paper gives an overview of participating life insurance (policies that pay dividends to policyholders)

Some of the dividend methods covered by this paper can be very complex in the real world. This paper provides only a basic description of them, and it's important to focus only on the level of detail provided for exam purposes. You will probably not fully grasp some of the concepts presented in this paper, but that's not needed for exam purposes.

Policies that pay policyholder dividends are usually called "participating" policies because the policyholders participate in the experience of the block. Many of the experience drivers are similar to NGE policies covered earlier, but in the US, participating policies are usually subject to model regs and ASOPs that are different from those created for NGEs.

## Key topics for the exam include:

- Process to set dividends
- Dividend payment options
- Types of dividend methods and formulas
- Dividend framework
- Recognition of policy activity
- Handling one-time changes and constraints
- Thought process when changing the dividend scale based on experience
- Par business issued by stock life insurance companies
- Different perspectives of "fair and equitable"
- Other considerations and forms of nonguaranteed elements


## Introduction

This paper describes how participating (par) policies work under the traditional approach to setting policyholder dividends

- Participating means that the policyholder participates in the experience of the insurer
- Par policyholders pay a higher premium than non-par policyholders but can receive nonguaranteed dividends in the future

Most par products are whole life, which is what this paper focuses on

- It's possible to have dividends on other types of insurance, but rare

## Page 45
Most par products are issued by mutual companies, while policies with other nonguaranteed elements are issued by stock companies ${ }^{30}$

- Only par policies paying dividends are in scope of this paper


# How Dividends Work 

## Definitions of dividend:

- Return of premium that was not needed
- Distribution of surplus that the insurer does not need to retain any longer

In the US and Canada, policyholder dividends are usually based on the contribution principle

- Each policy's dividend $=$ allocation of aggregate divisible in proportion to what the policy contributed to surplus based on experience factor classes


## Process To Set Dividends

- Declaration by Board, after recommendation by management and/or dividend actuary
- Board determines the amount of divisible surplus
* Must balance the need to pay higher dividends (competitiveness) with the need to retain surplus for future needs (new business, solvency)
* Consider surplus impact on ratings
- Board authorizes a dividend scale recommended by management and/or a dividend actuary
* Interactive, back and forth process
* Usually starts with prior year and looks at changes in experience since then
- Distribution to individual policies according to dividend scale adopted
- Dividends are usually paid annually based on the dividend scale in effect on a policy's anniversary
- Ideally the dividend scale will be known at least a month before each policy anniversary so the dividend amount can be communicated on the policyholder's premium notice
- Off-anniversary dividends are payable on death and sometimes other terminations (beyond scope of paper)


## Dividend Payment Options

Common dividend options that policyholders can select (for how they receive the dividend):

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{30}$ A mutual life insurance company is one owned by policyholders. A stock company is owned by stockholders.

## Page 46
- Cash
- Apply toward premium and apply any excess to another option
- Purchase paid-up additions (PUAs) that match the basic policy's coverage period
- Purchase PUAs parallel to basic policy's coverage, including final endowment ${ }^{31}$
- Purchase one-year term insurance addition
- Leave on deposit in a dividend accumulation fund (interest rate could be guaranteed plus a nonguaranteed excess amount)


# Additional dividend options for specialized markets or other special situations: 

- Combination of PUAs and term additions that shift over time to achieve a target layer of coverage
- Called "economic" and "enhancement" in the US and Canada, respectively
- Purchase PUAs in early years, then surrender them in later years to offset premiums
- Important to communicate that dividends are not guaranteed, so premiums may not be fully offset
- Combinations of dividend use and policy loans to "achieve desired cash flows"


## Types of Dividend Methods and Formulas

## 3 principal sources of earnings for dividend payments:

1. Mortality - biggest source initially and rises gradually, then falls as net amount at risk declines
2. Investment - small initially but eventually becomes the dominant source later as the policy accumulates more assets
3. Expense - fairly small and constant over the life of the policy

Gains from these 3 sources add up to the total dividend paid to the policyholder

## Common Dividend Methods

## 1. Contribution Method

- Based on a 3-factor formula for mortality, investment, and expense

$$
\operatorname{Div}_{x, t}=\left(q-q^{\prime \prime}\right)\left(\text { Face }-\operatorname{Res}_{x, t}\right)+\left(i^{\prime \prime}-i\right)\left(\operatorname{Res}_{x, t-1}+\mathrm{NP}_{x}\right)+\left(\operatorname{Exp}_{x, t}-\operatorname{Exp}_{x, t}^{\prime \prime}\right)
$$

where:

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{31}$ The author does not explain how this option is different from the previous one, and it's not $100 \%$ clear from the language in the paper. In both cases, the idea is to use each dividend to purchase fully paid-up additions to the total death benefit. This increases the policyholder's DB over time but does not increase the premium since the additions are fully paid up.

## Page 47
$\left(q-q^{\prime \prime}\right)=$ valuation mortality rate minus mortality rate used to distribute surplus $\left(\right.$ Face $\left.-\operatorname{Res}_{x, t}\right)=$ net amount at risk
$\left(i^{\prime \prime}-i\right)=$ interest rate used to distributed surplus minus valuation interest rate $\left(\operatorname{Res}_{x, t-1}+\mathrm{NP}_{x}\right)=$ initial reserve at BOY $t$ after valuation NP is added $\left(\operatorname{Exp}_{x, t}-\operatorname{Exp}_{x, t}^{\prime \prime}\right)=$ expense allowance (loading in gross premium) minus expense allocated to the policy

- Any of the 3 components can be positive or negative
- $q^{\prime \prime}, i^{\prime \prime}$, and $\operatorname{Exp}^{\prime \prime}$ are not exact insurer experience since it wouldn't be known until $\mathrm{EOY}^{32}$
- Instead, these values are set by the insurer to retain some profit or reconcile aggregate dividends to divisible surplus
- May also include additional factors for specific situations
- Relatively simple as experience factors less explicit margins are used in the formula
- The difference between select and ultimate mortality can also be used to help offset/amortize acquisition costs


# 2. Experience Premium Method 

- One possible formula:

$$
\operatorname{Div}_{x, t}=\left(i^{\prime \prime}-i^{\prime \prime \prime}\right)\left(\operatorname{EPRes}_{x, t-1}^{\prime \prime}+\mathrm{EP}_{x}^{\prime \prime \prime}\right)+\left(\mathrm{GP}_{x}-\mathrm{EP}_{x}^{\prime \prime \prime}\right)
$$

- Using the above formula, dividends $=$ sum of:
(a) Excess of the interest rate used to distribute surplus ( $i^{\prime \prime}$ ) over a conservative, low interest rate $\left(i^{\prime \prime \prime}\right)$
$\left(\operatorname{EPRes}_{x, t-1}^{\prime \prime \prime}+\mathrm{EP}_{x}^{\prime \prime \prime}\right)=$ initial reserve at BOY $t$ based on the same assumptions as the experience premium $\mathrm{EP}^{\prime \prime \prime}$
(b) Proxy gross premium (GP) minus an experience premium ( $\mathrm{EP}^{\prime \prime \prime}$ ) based on mortality and expense experience
- Advantages:
- Investment factor is likely positive and will increase over time even if returns are low
- Levels out mortality and expense gains over the life of the policy (no need to update mortality and expense factors)
- Relatively simple since only the investment component needs updating

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{32}$ The author says that you could denote actual experience with a single prime (e.g. $q^{\prime}$ ), but it's not clear how that would be used in the formula since he says that actual experience won't be known soon enough to compute dividends.

## Page 48
# 3. Asset Share Method ${ }^{33}$ 

- Attempts to be more equitable by developing a dividend scale that results in an acceptable pattern of asset shares for representative cells
- Asset shares can be evaluated at an anchor duration (e.g. 20th year)
- Cells are defined by issue age, gender, underwriting class, size, etc.
- Uses the same 3-factor formula as the Contribution Method with the following differences:
- Asset Share method uses best estimate assumptions
- "The factors will not represent the earnings from that source, but rather will represent just what is needed to reproduce a dividend formula designed to result in a certain pattern of asset shares"
- After analyzing representative cells, interpolate/extrapolate to all other possible cells so that dividend scales can be developed for all policies
- Can be complicated to update for inforce policies
- Requires a re-projection of asset shares, replacing expected experience with actual experience
- Adjust dividend scale to return to the original target pattern of assets shares
- May be useful in demonstrating compliance with self-supporting rules in the NAIC illustration regulation


## 4. Fund Method

- Projects a target fund $=$ reserve + an "amount $A$ " from issue to an anchor duration (e.g. 20th year)
- "Amount A" grows to a target surplus at the anchor duration
- Can be adjusted to achieve a desired pattern of dividends ${ }^{34}$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{33}$ The asset share method is described with very little detail in the paper, and unless you've seen it in practice, it will probably be difficult to understand what's going on just from this paper. In a life insurance pricing context, a policy's "asset share" is the share of the insurer's assets attributable to that policy. It's essentially an accumulation of the cash flows produced by the policy (premiums in, expenses out, etc. accumulated with interest). Pricing actuaries use asset shares to evaluate premiums and other pricing assumptions. Since dividends would be another benefit paid to the policyholder, they can be incorporated into an asset share model so that the dividend actuary can evaluate how dividends affect asset shares. For this exam, you only need a very vague understanding of asset shares since there's so little information about it in this paper.
    ${ }^{34}$ In the author's words, "One supposes some attention during product development is paid to the resulting pattern of dividends expected, and the pattern of amount A development over time may be crafted to some degree to allow a steadier pattern of dividends, if necessary." The author does not mention "amount A" again or include it in any formulas. See the video lesson for more explanation.

## Page 49
- Does not contain steps to develop dividend scales or asset shares for individual model cells ${ }^{35}$
- Uses best estimate assumptions (similar to those used for the asset share method)
- Dividend formula:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{Div}_{x, t}= & \left(\text { Fund }_{x, t-1}-\text { Fund }_{x, t}\right)+\mathrm{GP}_{x}+i^{\prime \prime}\left(\text { Fund }_{x, t-1}+\mathrm{GP}_{x}\right) \\
& -q^{\prime \prime}(\text { Face })-\operatorname{Exp}_{x, t}^{\prime \prime}-\text { OtherExp }_{t}
\end{aligned}
$$

where:
$\left(\right.$ Fund $_{x, t-1}-$ Fund $\left._{x, t}\right)=$ negative of growth in target fund (i.e. a charge for required growth)
$i^{\prime \prime}=$ interest rate used to distributed surplus
Fund $_{x, t-1}+\mathrm{GP}_{x}=$ required fund at BOY after GP is added
$q^{\prime \prime}($ Face $)=$ death benefit based on mortality rate used to distribute surplus
$\operatorname{Exp}_{x, t}^{\prime \prime}=$ expense allocated to policy
OtherExp = other benefits and expenses (e.g. commissions and taxes)

- May be easier and less arbitrary than the asset share method
- Can develop consistent rules across plans with the fund method
- Solving for dividend scales using asset shares can be arbitrary and "misleadingly similar to the Contribution Method"
- Like the asset share method, updating dividend scales can be tedious
- Adjust dividends to return to the targeted pattern of funds, replacing expected experience with actual
- Like the asset share method, can be useful for self-support tests


# Concepts That Appear in the Formulas 

- Policy factors - values set by the product for premiums, cash values, face amount, policy loan interest rate
- Experience factors - mortality/morbidity rates, premium persistency, expense, commissions, taxes, investment income, policy termination, reinsurance
- Also experience premiums for the EP method
- Experience factor class - group of policies whose dividends are based on the same experience factors

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{35}$ There isn't enough detail in the paper to fully process this statement from the author, but I don't think he's saying you can't develop dividend scales because he goes on to provide a formula framework that can be used to develop dividends. He's probably comparing the methods based on specifics that are not in the paper.

## Page 50
- A given policy will belong to several experience factor classes


# Possible Variations 

Variations of the previous methods also exist

- Developments affecting new business may require updates to dividends for existing business
- The insurer may monitor ratios of accumulated profit to risk charges and adjust dividends as necessary to maintain targets

As experience emerges, it is expressed in terms of "experience factors input to a model" because:

- It is not practical to track a gain and loss exhibit separately for each model cell
- It would prevent the pooling mechanism of insurance

Dividends can be calculated on a per 1000 (per unit) basis and loaded into admin systems in tables

- E.g. if the dividend per unit for a female age 60 with a 100,000 face policy is 5 , the dividend would be $100 \times 5=500$
- Other admin systems may be designed to calculate dividends from first principles using the formulas described earlier


## Dividend Framework

It's important for a dividend framework to allocate divisible surplus in an equitable manner and that is consistent over time

The actuary must be able to explain why dividends vary within any given year by plan, issue age, duration, underwriting class, size, etc.

- Duration is particularly important for policy illustrations

The actuary should also be able to explain variations over time and why actual dividend scales differed from illustrated scales

The following should be consistent over time so that the contribution principle is followed:

- Assignment of policies to experience factor classes
- Allocation methods for experience factors
- Structure of formulas for using experience factors


## Recognition Of Policy Activity

May insurers also reflect policyholder choices that cause profitability to vary for otherwise identical policies:

## Page 51
- Purchase of PUAs: results in higher coverage, which increases mortality and investment profit sources
- Leaving dividends on deposit: increases investment profit source
- Use of riders for additional coverage (temporary term, accidental death, disability)
- Some insurers incorporate these into the base policy's experience factors, while others have an explicit term for them in the dividend formula
- Policyholder may accept an offer to amend their policy based on new underwriting, regulations, or tax issues
- Policy loan utilization or any other optional feature that affects policy values


# Handling One-Time Changes 

## Examples of temporary changes that could affect aggregate distributable surplus

- Large capital gains/losses that impact income immediately (excludes IMR-related items for US stat)
- Catastrophic mortality event
- Spike in lapse rates (or extreme lack of lapses)
- Release of a liability held for litigation or tax audit
- Major loss in litigation
- Retroactive liability established because of a change in law or court ruling


## Examples of permanent changes that could affect aggregate distributable surplus

- Changes in experience factors to new levels
- Reinsurance cost on existing business
- Change in tax law
- Additional obligations for increasing expenses, benefits, reserves, etc.
- Changes in dividend scale to increase equitability
- Board-approved changes in surplus growth to meet changing ERM, new business, or competitive objectives

Questions to consider when making a one-time change to dividends:

- Which policyholders should be affected (maybe not all)
- Whether the impact can be spread over a few years to moderate it
- Also consider that temporary changes will eventually reverse
- Use of smoothing methods to avoid declines and discontinuities in dividend payments

## Page 52
- Pegging - continue paying prior dividend until dividends on the new scale exceed it
- Substitution - continue paying original scale from issue even if the scale changes shortly after issue
- Experience Premium Method - can also be used to smooth dividends after changes ${ }^{36}$
- How to communicate the change to policyholders and emphasize the nonguaranteed nature of dividends
- How to reflect in future illustrations for new and inforce business
- How to reflect in asset adequacy testing, self-support testing, EV, etc.


# Constraints and Context 

- Allocation based on past contributions, but with "an eye to the future"
- The Contribution Principle is about distributing historical gains
- However, some actuaries may choose to apply it over an extended period of time to help plan for future surplus needs
* ASOP 15 gives the actuary this option
- Relationships between existing business in force and new business
- In Canada, experience factor classes are established at issue and not expected to change
- In the US, experience factor classes may be updated over time as conditions change
- Examples of distinctions that should be made even if experience is pooled:
* Mortality: create an experience mortality table graduated over age/duration, or modify an existing mortality table
- Reflect relationships among issue ages, durations, underwriting classes/eras
- Allows the actuary to increase credibility by pooling cells with too few lives
- Reflect known changes in underwriting, markets, regulation, etc.
* Expense: changing expenses can affect allocations between new and existing business
- Consistency is best
- In Canada, the Insurance Companies Act requires Board approval of the allocation method and an annual opinion on whether the method is fair/equitable

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{36}$ The author does not explain how to go about this, but presumably you would recalculate the EP with updated assumptions. This would help levelize the effect of changing experience over the life of the policy.

## Page 53
* Investment: different insurers have different philosophies for distinguishing investment experience factor classes
- May be influenced by market interest rate movements


# - Effect on regulatory/statutory liabilities 

- Dividends not taken in cash (e.g. PUAs) will remain on the insurer's book balance sheet as liabilities
- In the US, insurers hold a liability for the amount of dividends declared for the next year
- Reflection of future dividends (beyond the next year)
* Ignored in US statutory reserves but are reflected in Canadian statutory liabilities
* Should be reflected in asset adequacy testing


## Case Studies In Increasing Or Decreasing the Dividend Scale

## Mixed Experience

Example of a scenario involved mixed recent experience during/after a pandemic:

- Steadily rising portfolio earned rate due to rising yields
- Temporary mortality spike at older ages, then return to normal
- Uncertainty about "long covid" effects on future mortality
- No change on persistency
- Future expenses likely to rise
- Steady surplus ratios
- Some competitors have increased dividend scales

Decision by the insurer's actuary and management:

- Don't change mortality or expense components of the dividend scale
- Use part of the investment experience gains to cover possible rising mortality and expense costs

Actuary should confirm that the revised scale does not cause any problems with:

- Self-support tests
- Asset adequacy analysis
- Internal procedural diligence requirements

Final actions:

## Page 54
- Actuary writes a report
- Board approves the change
- Admin and new business systems are updated/tested
- Announcements are made to the field force and public


# Deteriorating Experience 

Another possible pandemic scenario:

- Insurer's earnings have been flat to decreasing
- Portfolio earned rate has been falling
- Pandemic mortality temporarily spiked at older ages and also ages 25-34 at durations 1115
- Uncertainty about "long covid" effects on future mortality
- No change on persistency
- Future expenses likely to rise
- Surplus ratios have fallen slightly but are still adequate
- No changes in competitors' dividend scales
- Field force opposes a reduction in dividend scale

Decision by the insurer's actuary and management:

- Don't change mortality or expense components of the dividend scale
- Increasing the mortality charge for the "problem point" at ages 25-34, durations 1115 is not a good idea because it would unfairly penalize future policies that pass into those age/duration ranges
- Lower the investment component by 15 bps
- Management decides it's too late to use pegging but recommends substitution for policies issued in the last 2 years

Final actions are the same as the previous scenario

## Par Business Issued by Stock Life Insurance Companies

While most par business is issued by mutual companies, 4 "historical situations" have resulted in stock companies with par business:

1. Par business issued back in the days before other forms of nonguaranteed life insurance was available

## Page 55
2. Demutualizations - when mutual companies convert to stock companies, existing par business continues to receive dividends using a "closed block" mechanism

- Closed block mechanism - a formal dividend protection mechanism created as part of a conversion of a mutual insurer to be a stock insurer (must be formally approved by the regulator) ${ }^{37}$

3. Some demutualized insurers continue selling new par policies
4. Conversions of mutual companies to a mutual insurance holding company structure

- Functionally the same as converting to a stock company
- Closed block mechanisms were used to protect existing par policyholders' dividends

Other organizations that issue par business: fraternal benefit organizations, not-for-profits, and charities

# Different Perspectives Of "Fair and Equitable" 

People have different views of what "fair and equitable" means, so the Board and the actuary should have a clear concept of what they believe is appropriate

## Unconstrained perspective is fundamentally retrospective

From simplest (most unconstrained) to more complicated/constrained:

1. Purely retrospective approach - return some portion of earnings based on how various business classes contributed to earnings
2. Variation of No. 1 - return historical earnings reduced by risk charges based on the risks taken by each product line
3. Contribution Principle - dividends are based not only on past earnings but also future risk (allocate smaller dividends to classes with higher future uncertainty)

Perspective may be broadened to improve the ability of the insurer to serve the public
If a dividend scale does not remain attractive, the healthiest lives will leave
Insurers may face pressure to change (or not change) a scale due to:

- Competition
- Consistency with new business
- Sustainability of the dividend scale given future expectations for experience
- Policyholder expectations
- This is a required consideration for "fair and equitable" in Canada
- Avoidance of losses that would result from policyholder or agent reactions

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{37}$ This definition appears later in the article, but it's helpful to include it here.

## Page 56
- Regulation expectations
- Complexity vs. practicality


# Perspective may be broadened to consider external challenges 

- External challenges that may affect the decision to change a dividend scale
- Sales illustrations vs illustrations of current dividend scale
- Competition (especially if NB is tied to the dividend scale)
- Financial reporting and ratings
- Litigation
- Perceptions by policyholders that prior illustrations were prospective estimates/promises
- External environment
- Some constraints on how/when a dividend scale is revised:
- Regulator interrogatories related to illustrations and policyholder treatment
- Problems that aren't addressed soon may only get worse in future years
- Investors who stand to gain or lose if a dividend scale is changed
- The strongest defenses against complaints about the insurer's dividend actions:
- Consistent and documented dividend framework based on the contribution principle to allocate dividends equitably
- Well-documented actions of the Board, taking into account the considerations above


## Perspective may need to consider the special circumstances of a Closed Block

- A demutualized insurer will likely have discretion to manage the dividend scale to reflect emerging experience or avoid a tontine ${ }^{38}$
- After demutualization, emphasis shifts away from reflecting the insurer's long-term emerging experience toward a more specific formula designed to "pay out the last dollar to the last policy" (avoid tontines, etc.)
- The closed block dividend scale should be simplified
- Make revisions to the aggregate dividend scale rather than refinements within the scale
- Could use a uniform factor applied across all cells that maintains the original relativity of dividends

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{38}$ A tontine occurs when the final surviving policyholders receive a larger dividend payout because surplus was not distributed as well as it should have been along the way.

## Page 57
- Disconnect the closed block scale from the NB scale so that the closed block scale can remain simple and unaffected by competitive pressure
- Updating sophisticated closed block scales does not benefit management or shareholders ${ }^{39}$


# Other Considerations 

This section of the paper lists "other considerations beyond the scope of this paper." By that, the author means that he is not going into any more detail about these topics than what he includes in the paper. However, since the information below is in the paper, it is fair game to be tested at the level of detail shown.

## - Authority of Board

- Court decisions - The Board's authority to distribute aggregate surplus has been determined by NY court decisions that give that authority to the Board rather than policyholders
- Revised targets - The actuary may revise earnings targets based on evolving required capital or target retained surplus
* Should be documented if targets change from one generation to the next


## - Actuary's Responsibility

- Dividend Actuary - guidance is provided by ASOP 15 (Allocation of Dividends) and ASOP 24 (Illustration of Dividends)
- Written Report - prepared by the dividend actuary pursuant to US ASOPs 15 and 41 or Canadian SoP subsection 2720


## - Experience Reflected

## - Investment Income

* Allocation methods: portfolio method, investment year method, investment generation method, investment segment method
* Treatment of policy loans - direct recognition at individual policy level vs. pooled with non-loaned assets, fixed interest rate vs. variable loan rates
- Reinsurance - how to reflect the impact of reinsurance
- Taxes - how to reflect taxes that aren't directly tied to a policy or that do not relate to current gains or current premiums
- Miscellaneous Gains - gains from outside the basic policy (e.g. riders, other LOBs, subsidiaries, etc.) or gains that are "borrowed" from another LOB


## - Special Situations

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{39}$ You will "not [receive] thanks from those individuals who benefit from increased dividends, but [you will receive] some complaints from those individuals who are disappointed by reduced dividends."

## Page 58
- Revised Blocks - subdivided blocks of business that have amended premiums, CSVs, or new underwriting classes
- Acquired Blocks - pooling experience factor classes vs. recognizing different credibility levels
- Demutualizations - dividend protection mechanisms and allocation of any compensation paid upon the conversion


# - Complement to Annual Dividends 

- Terminal Dividends - a pattern of fixed dividends varying by policy year to be paid on surrender or death
* Established at policy issue to be distinct from a simple pro-rata share of the annual dividend
* Reflect the release of retained surplus at termination


## Other Forms Of Nonguaranteed Elements

The following are alternatives to par contracts:

- Indeterminate premium life insurance or guaranteed renewable disability insurance
- Discretionary credited rates that can exceed guaranteed rates on account values
- Discretionary COI charges that are lower than the guaranteed max rates
- Variable investment performance on variable or unit-linked products
- Limiting the insured period, followed by a renewable period where the insurer can adjust contract terms

## Overview of This Reading

The syllabus page range for this study note includes only the first 14 pages of Life Insurance Products and Finance Ch. 11

This page range covers basic profit calculations under solvency (US statutory) and stockholder (US GAAP) accounting

## Key topics for the exam include:

- After-tax solvency earnings
- Distributable earnings
- Stockholder earnings
- ROE
- Selection of profit goals


## Distributable Earnings

Distributable earnings are equal to solvency earnings minus the increase in required capital
"Solvency earnings" is a generic phrase for US statutory earnings. All of the mechanics here are based on US statutory accounting concepts. In Canada, there is a single set of books for both solvency and GAAP reserves (now mostly based on IFRS 17). So just think "US statutory" when you see "solvency" in this chapter.

Positive distributable earnings represent the maximum amount that can be paid to stockholders in a given period

Negative distributable earnings represent the amount stockholders need to pay in to keep the company going

\operatorname{DistrEarn}_{t} & =\operatorname{AfterTaxSolvEarn}_{t}-\operatorname{ReqCapIncr}_{t}+\operatorname{ATInvIncRC}_{t}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that required capital may earn a different investment income rate and could have a different tax rate

## Page 61
Reinsurance cash flows should be netted against the direct cash flows
Example: NetPrem $=$ DirectPrem - CededPrem
If the distributable earnings are calculated for a time horizon $(n)$ less than the policy's final year, there are two methods for adjusting the distributable earnings:

1. Release all remaining required capital at time $n$ so that $\operatorname{ReqCap}(n)=0$
2. Set the final lapse rate in year $n$ to $100 \%$, which zeros out all final amounts

# Stockholder Earnings 

Stockholder earnings are earnings calculated primarily for a stockholder (investor) audience
"Stockholder earnings" is a generic phrase for US GAAP earnings. All of the mechanics here are based on US GAAP accounting concepts. IFRS 17 would be the closest analog to US GAAP in Canada, but IFRS 17 uses several different mechanisms that do not appear in this chapter. So just think "US GAAP" when you see "stockholder earnings."

After-tax earnings that result from earnings reserves, which are net U.S. GAAP reserves

$$
\text { EarningsRes }_{t}=\text { BenRes }_{t}-\mathrm{DAC}_{t}
$$

$\mathrm{DAC}=$ deferred acquisition cost asset (offsets high first-year acquisition costs, then amortizes them into income over time)

- DACAmort $=$ DAC amortization expense included in income

BenRes $=$ benefit reserve (based on a reserve method somewhat similar to SolvRes but using different, less conservative assumptions)

Product cash flows and investment income are the same as those used for solvency earnings Investment income is the same because invested assets are still equal to solvency reserves + required capital

$$
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{PreTaxStockEarn}_{t}= & \operatorname{ProdCashFlow}_{t}+\operatorname{InvIncome}_{t}-\operatorname{BenResIncr}_{t} \\
& -\mathrm{DACAmort}_{t}+\operatorname{InvIncRC}_{t} \\
= & \operatorname{PreTaxSolvEarn}_{t}+\operatorname{SolvResIncr}_{t}-\operatorname{BenResIncr}_{t} \\
& -\mathrm{DACAmort}_{t}+\operatorname{InvIncRC}_{t} \\
= & \operatorname{PreTaxSolvEarn}_{t}+\operatorname{SolvResIncr}_{t}-\operatorname{EarningsResIncr}_{t}+\operatorname{InvIncRC}_{t} \\
\text { AfterTaxStockEarn }_{t}= & \operatorname{PreTaxStockEarn}_{t}-\operatorname{Tax}_{t}-\operatorname{TaxInvIncRC}_{t}-\operatorname{DefTaxProv}_{t}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Page 62
# Return on Equity (ROE) 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Annual } \mathrm{ROE}_{t} & =\frac{\text { AfterTaxStockEarn }_{t}}{\text { EquityBase }_{t}} \\
\text { EquityBase } & =\text { StockAssets }- \text { StockLiab } \\
\text { Stock Assets } & =\text { SolvRes }+ \text { ReqCap }+ \text { DAC } \\
\text { StockLiab } & =\text { BenRes }+ \text { DefTaxLiab }
\end{aligned}
$$

The equity base can be based on the BOY equity base as calculated above or the average mid-year equity base:

$$
\text { MidYearEquityBase }_{t}=\frac{\text { EquityBase }_{t}+\text { EquityBase }_{t-1}}{2}
$$

The deferred tax liability concept will be developed in more detail in LPM-148

## Selection of Profit Goals

## 1. Select an accounting basis

Solvency is generally best for pricing decisions since solvency is more important to ratings companies and regulators
Some companies place heavy emphasis on stockholder earnings instead

## 2. Determine how to reflect risk

3 ways to reflect risk in pricing (i.e. setting profit margin):

- Develop a formula as a function of risk (mortality, expense, investment, etc.)
- Use judgment to estimate degree of risk
- Use sensitivity analysis to estimate risk

The approach should be realistic, based on best estimate assumptions (avoid being too conservative)

## 3. Determine what interest rate to use

The rate should reflect the following: cost of capital and the opportunity cost of other ventures

- Cost of capital = weighted average of a company's various sources of capital
- Sources of capital include stockholder equity, debt, and reinsurance
- Opportunity cost $=$ return on alternative ventures with similar risk
- Current and expected future capital position
- Use of discounting
- Companies commonly use pre- or after-tax yield on invested assets
- Use CoC if determining whether product produces an acceptable rate of return

## Page 63
If taxes are a level percentage of pre-tax profits, then pre-tax and after-tax earnings will have the same rate of return

It is usually more appropriate to price on an after-tax basis, but a case can be made for pricing pre-tax if:

- The insurer has effective strategies for minimizing taxes
- Countries with constantly changing tax laws

## Overview of This Reading

This study note is based on Ch. 9 of the textbook Life Insurance Products and Finance
We've already seen how to calculate after-tax profit in earlier readings
This chapter takes a deeper dive into the calculation of income taxes ("tax on earnings") that flow into after-tax solvency and stockholder earnings as well as other tax concepts

The video lesson for this reading has many numerical examples to help illustrate how each tax item works and also serve to reinforce important profit calculations that relate to other profit and performance measurement concepts elsewhere on the syllabus

## Key topics for the exam include:

- How to calculate tax on earnings
- Timing differences vs. permanent differences
- Capital gains and losses
- Tax on capital
- Deferred taxes
- DAC tax


## Tax on Earnings

Once you have taxable earnings, calculating taxes is straightforward:

$$
\text { Tax }=\text { TaxRate } \times \text { TaxableEarn }
$$

## Pre-Tax Earnings

Taxable earnings are developed from pre-tax earnings, which could be on either a solvency (US statutory) or stockholder (GAAP) basis

$$
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{ProdCashFlow}(t)= & \operatorname{Prem}(t)-\operatorname{Ben}(t)-\operatorname{Exp}(t) \\
\operatorname{PreTaxSolvEarn}(t)= & \operatorname{ProdCashFlow}(t)+\operatorname{InvIncome}(t)-\operatorname{SolvResIncr}(t) \\
\operatorname{PreTaxStockEarn}(t)= & \operatorname{ProdCashFlow}(t)+\operatorname{InvIncome}(t)-\operatorname{BenResIncr}(t) \\
& -\operatorname{DACAmort}(t)+\operatorname{InvIncRC}(t) \\
= & \operatorname{PreTaxSolvEarn}(t)+\operatorname{SolvResIncr}(t)-\operatorname{BenResIncr}(t) \\
& -\operatorname{DACAmort}(t)+\operatorname{InvIncRC}(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

The net GAAP reserve is also called the earnings reserve in this chapter:

$$
\operatorname{EarnRes}(t)=\operatorname{BenRes}(t)-\operatorname{DAC}(t)
$$

## Page 65
Therefore:
$\operatorname{PreTaxStockEarn}(t)=\operatorname{ProdCashFlow}(t)+\operatorname{InvIncome}(t)-\operatorname{EarnResIncr}(t)+\operatorname{InvIncRC}(t)$

# Taxable Earnings 

Calculating taxable earnings usually requires making two types of adjustments to solvency earnings:

1. Timing differences - differences in earnings bases that will eventually reverse over time (a.k.a. "temporary differences")

- Examples of timing differences between solvency and taxable earnings:
- Reserve calculations - interest, mortality, methods
- Treatment of assets - gains/losses, carrying values, amortization
- Different treatment of liabilities for incurred claims, policyholder dividends, etc.
- Liabilities not recognized for tax purposes - reserves to stabilize investment returns (IMR), reserves to offset future capital losses, required capital
- This chapter only focuses on timing differences between reserve bases

$$
\operatorname{TimingDiff}(t)=\operatorname{SolvResIncr}(t)-\operatorname{TaxResIncr}(t)
$$

- If the only differences in solvency earnings and taxable earnings is the reserve basis, total earnings will be the same in both cases (only the timing is affected)
- Regulators prefer more conservative values for assets and liabilities (tends to lower solvency earnings)
- Tax authorities prefer higher tax revenue (higher asset values and lower liability values)
- Significant timing differences should be reflected in pricing

2. Permanent differences - differences that will not reverse

- Examples:
- Nontaxable investment income
- Tax credits for research and development
- Non-deductible expenses
- This chapter will only consider permanent differences based on non-deductible investment income

$$
\operatorname{PermDiff}(t)=-\operatorname{InvIncome}(t) \times \operatorname{NonTaxInvPct}(t)
$$

## Page 66
# Capital Gains and Losses 

Capital gains/losses can create both timing differences and permanent differences

- Example: in the US, capital gains are immediately taxable, but capital losses can only offset capital gains

Capital losses can be carried forward up to 3 years and used against capital gains

- However if not used, they expire, creating a permanent difference

For example, suppose the company realizes capital gains of 40 and capital losses of 100 during 2020. This will result in zero taxable capital gains 2020. The company can carry forward the remaining 60 of capital losses to offset any capital gains in 2021-2023. However, if there are no more capital gains in those 3 years, solvency earnings will be permanently lower than taxable earnings by 60 (because the remaining 60 of capital losses never affected taxable earnings).

## Formulas for Taxable Earnings

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { TaxableEarn }(t) & =\operatorname{PreTaxSolvEarn}(t)+\text { TimingDiff }(t)+\operatorname{PermDiff}(t) \\
& =\operatorname{PreTaxSolvEarn}(t)+\operatorname{SolvResIncr}(t)-\operatorname{TaxResIncr}(t)+\operatorname{PermDiff}(t) \\
& =\operatorname{ProdCashFlow}(t)+\operatorname{InvIncome}(t)-\operatorname{TaxResIncr}(t)+\operatorname{PermDiff}(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

When calculating taxes, use the appropriate tax rate (or rates if the rates are progressive)
Assuming there is only one tax rate:

$$
\operatorname{Tax}(t)=\operatorname{TaxRate} \times \operatorname{TaxableEarn}(t)
$$

## Tax Losses

A company cannot pay negative taxes in total for any given tax year
Since life insurance policies usually generate losses in the first year, the company will want to use those taxable losses to offset other taxable gains

- Generally not a concern for large insurers, but could be an issue for a small company that doesn't have enough positive taxable earnings from other sources

Insurers who cannot immediately deduct tax losses when selling a new life insurance product will require more capital investment

- Results in a lower ROI, etc.


## Tax on Investment Income Less Expenses (I-E)

This section of the chapter describes a fairly archaic form of life insurance taxation that is an alternative to taxing earnings (as described in the previous section). The "I-E" method is not used in the US or Canada, and there has been a global movement away from it for quite some time. Therefore, this material is probably less relevant to the exam.

## Page 67
The tax on $I-E$ attempts to indirectly tax the annual increase in the policyholders' value in addition to the insurer's earnings

$$
\operatorname{InvIncome}(t)-\operatorname{Exp}(t)=\underbrace{\operatorname{Ben}(t)+\operatorname{SolvResIncr}(t)-\operatorname{Prem}(t)}_{\text {value created for policyholders }}+\operatorname{PreTaxSolvEarn}(t)
$$

The solvency reserve increase can be thought of as future policyholder benefits (like a cash value)

- So it's like taxing policyholders on the value they received in excess of premiums paid in In the simplest case, the tax on $I-E$ is simply:

$$
\text { IETaxRate } \times[\operatorname{InvIncome}(t)-\operatorname{Exp}(t)]
$$

However, there are usually a number of adjustments applied to both investment income and expenses for the purpose of this tax

Some countries have only partially abandoned tax on $I-E$ and use it as a minimum level of tax

- $\operatorname{Tax}=\max (\operatorname{tax}$ on earnings, tax on $I-E)$

In the US and Canada, insurers are taxed only on earnings, and policyholders are taxed if/when they surrender their policy subject to tax law in each country

- Once again, the I - E method is not used at all in North America


# Tax on Capital 

Certain types of capital maybe subject to tax (e.g. mutual companies may pay tax on imputed stockholder dividends from the participating surplus account)

Any capital subject to such a tax will be called "tax capital"

$$
\operatorname{TaxOnCap}(t)=\operatorname{TaxCapital}(t) \times \operatorname{CapTaxRate}(t)
$$

This tax may be assessed in addition to tax on earnings or used as a minimum level of tax

## Deferred Taxes

For GAAP accounting purposes, it is undesirable for taxes to be a non-level percentage of earnings

Instead of reporting the actual amount of taxes paid, GAAP accounting will report taxes on an

## Page 68
accrued basis so that taxes emerge as a level $\%$ of stockholder earnings

$$
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{Tax}(t) & =\text { TaxRate } \times \text { TaxableEarnings } \\
\text { AccruedTax }(t) & =\text { TaxRate } \times \text { PreTaxStockEarn }(t) \\
\operatorname{DefTaxProv}(t) & =\text { AccruedTax }(t)-\operatorname{Tax}(t) \\
\text { AfterTaxStockEarn }(t) & =\text { PreTaxStockEarn }(t)-\text { AccruedTax }(t) \\
& =(1-\text { TaxRate }) \times \text { PreTaxStockEarn }(t) \\
\operatorname{DefTaxLiab}(t) & =\operatorname{DefTaxLiab}(t-1)+\operatorname{DefTaxProv}(t) \\
& =\text { TaxRate } \times[\operatorname{TaxRes}(t)-\operatorname{EarnRes}(t)]
\end{aligned}
$$

The deferred tax liability (or asset if negative) is the corresponding GAAP balance sheet item

- DefTaxLiab $>0$ when the current tax reserve is greater than the net GAAP reserves (earnings reserves)
- This is the most common situation
- Indicates that taxable earnings have been lower than GAAP earnings to date (because the tax reserve built up faster)
- Eventually the timing difference between tax and GAAP reserves will reverse, causing future taxes to increase
- If DefTaxLiab $<0$, the DefTaxLiab is actually a deferred tax asset (exact same math though)
- I.e. taxes will be lower in the future relative to the past

The DefTaxLiab has mystified many exam candidates before you and will likely mystify many in the future. However, it is simply an interest-free reserve for future taxes under GAAP accounting. If you're familiar with the basic idea of GAAP accounting, you'll know that there are many GAAP mechanisms designed to levelize revenues and costs so that earnings are more stable over time. This is based on that same goal. Note that you can also write after-tax stockholder earnings as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { AfterTaxStockEarn }(t) & =\text { PreTaxStockEarn }(t)-\operatorname{Tax}(t)-\operatorname{DefTaxLiabIncr}(t) \\
& =\operatorname{PreTaxStockEarn}(t)-\operatorname{Tax}(t)-\operatorname{DefTaxProv}(t) \\
& =\operatorname{PreTaxStockEarn}(t)-\operatorname{Tax}(t)-[\operatorname{AccruedTax}(t)-\operatorname{Tax}(t)] \\
& =\operatorname{PreTaxStockEarn}(t)-\operatorname{AccruedTax}(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

In other words, the deferred tax liability serves to "convert" actual taxes into taxes reported on an accrued basis. This forces taxes to emerge as a level \% (the tax rate itself) of pre-tax stockholder earnings

$$
\frac{\text { AccruedTax }(t)}{\text { PreTaxStockEarn }(t)}=\frac{\text { TaxRate } \times \text { PreTaxStockEarn }(t)}{\text { PreTaxStockEarn }(t)}=\text { TaxRate }
$$

# Appendix: DAC Tax 

Common point of confusion: Many people wrongly assume this is a GAAP accounting concept because of the word "DAC." DAC tax has nothing to do with GAAP accounting. DAC tax is specific to US tax

## Page 69
accounting and affects the amount of taxable earnings used to calculate the tax on earnings. It borrows its name from the GAAP version of "DAC" because somewhat like GAAP DAC, DAC tax capitalizes and defers amounts into the future.

DAC tax is a US tax accounting mechanism that serves to temporarily increase taxable income as premiums are collected and is then reversed out of taxable income over a period of years in the future

The net effect is to accelerate tax payments to the IRS because there is no interest adjustment
The amount added to taxable income each period is expressed as a $\%$ of premium collected ( $7.7 \%$ for individual life and $1.75 \%$ for annuities)

- These amounts are then subtracted from taxable income on a prorated basis over the next 10 years

For a given year, DACTaxAmount $(t)=$ additions to DAC tax - deductions from DAC tax
For example, for each premium collected (in any policy year) for a life insurance product:

| Year | Add to Taxable Earnings | Deduct From Taxable Earnings |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 1 | $7.7 \%$ | $5 \%$ of $7.7 \%$ |
| $2-10$ | 0 | $10 \%$ of $7.7 \%$ |
| 11 | 0 | $5 \%$ of $7.7 \%$ |

This amount is added to the taxable earnings calculated earlier:

$$
\text { TaxableEarn }(t)=\text { PreTaxSolvEarn }(t)+\text { TimingDiff }(t)+\text { PermDiff }(t)+\text { DACTaxAmount }(t)
$$

Rather than memorize the DACTaxAmount formula shown in the book, I think it's far easier to just understand conceptually how to do the math. See the video lesson for straightforward example that you can easily generalize for any situation and also more information on how DACTax impacts the profitability of life insurance products.

# Notes on 2018 Tax Law Changes 

The content of this source reading was created well before the 2018 changes to US tax law, and the information on DAC tax above is very out of date. A newer study note coming up next in the course (LPM-150) mentions a few key changes to DAC tax:

- DAC tax rate increased from $7.7 \%$ to $9.2 \%$ for individual life and from $1.75 \%$ to $2.09 \%$ for annuities
- Amortization period extended from 10 years to 15 years

The math behind DAC tax is unchanged, and I think you can demonstrate your understanding of DAC tax sufficiently on the exam using either the old or new DAC tax rates and amortization periods.

# Impact of VM-20 on Life Insurance Product Development 

Source Author: Milliman (November 2016)

## Pages 1-31 (excluding discussion of 20-year term)

## Overview of This Reading

VM-20 is the section of the NAIC's Valuation Manual that contains the new principles-based reserve framework for life insurance statutory reserves and has an effective date of 1/1/2017

This SOA-sponsored report looks how VM-20 will impact the product development process and focuses on Phase 1 of the research, which uses hypothetical case studies for term and UL with secondary guarantees (ULSG) to determine how PBR will change the product development process for large insurers

Instructional note: The detailed study manual focuses on verbal descriptions of the results in the paper, but I think the video lesson makes the key points much clearer (and easier to retain) through some simple examples and visuals.

Also, note that the current syllabus says to ignore all of the 20-year term results in the paper. Honestly, the 20-year term results are not that different from the 10-year term product, so I don't think it will be very distracting.

## Key topics for the exam include:

- Understand the basic requirements of VM-20, including the 3 required reserves
- Understand how reserve financing generates tax benefits
- Key drivers of term and ULSG results in each pricing situation
- Sensitivity results for term and ULSG
- Possible product design impacts based on case study results


## Some Backstory on Reserve Financing and Related Terminology

This paper assumes the reader knows MUCH more about the complex world of US statutory valuation for term and ULSG than most people taking the LPM exam will have. As a result, there is a lot of terminology in this paper that won't make much sense to most LPM exam-takers. So here's a little background to make it more meaningful. . .

Many term and ULSG products are subject to Regulation XXX and AG 38 ("AXXX"), respectively, which require insurers to hold very high stat reserves-well in excess of the best estimate liability. It's not important to know why these regulations exist for now. You will get a big dose of that on ILA-FM.

The stat reserve required by XXX and AG 38 is called the Model 830 reserve. Many insurers finance (borrow money) to back the excess of Model 830 reserve the best estimate reserve (often called the "economic reserve").

In reality, companies often use reinsurance to accomplish the financing-i.e. cede the excess reserve to a

## Page 71
reinsurer. Sometimes the reinsurer is owned by the same parent company and is called a "captive," which is mentioned at least once in the body of the reading.

AG 48 is an actuarial guideline that provides guidance on XXX/AXXX reserve financing transactions, and you will see mentions of AG 48 in this paper.

# Overview of VM-20 Impact on Term and ULSG 

|  | IRR Impact |  |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |
|  | Term | ULSG |
| Excess reserves NOT financed | Higher | Immaterial impact |
| Excess reserves financed | Lower | Lower |

For financed term and ULSG, the lower IRR resulted from the loss of tax benefits

- Higher reserves $=$ higher tax deduction
- VM-20 reserves are much lower than the high stat XXX reserves pre-PBR (Model 830 reserves)


## Possible pricing impacts:

- VM-20 may allow non-financed term writers to lower premiums to be more competitive or maintain higher profits
- VM-20 may force financed term and ULSG writers to raise premiums or accept lower profits

The above points are the absolute critical takeaways from the research, but it is important to also understand details underlying why things come out this way.

## High-Level Summary of VM-20 Requirements

The principles-based methodology in VM-20 requires the calculation of 3 reserves:

## 1. Net premium reserve (NPR)

- Seriatim formulaic reserve using prescribed assumptions for mortality, lapse, and interest
- The valuation interest rate is locked in at issue, but prescribed mortality and lapses could change after issue


## 2. Deterministic reserve (DR)

- Aggregate gross premium reserve $=$ PV of pretax liability cash flows at discount rates under a prescribed scenario
- Discount rate based on existing assets and reinvestments under VM-20 assumptions
- Experience assumptions = mix of company experience and prescribed
- Includes margins on mortality, etc.
- After issue, the DR will be affected by:

## Page 72
- Emerging experience (mortality, lapse, expense, policyholder behavior, etc.)
- Changing asset earnings
- Changes in CSO valuation mortality
- Revisions to mortality margins
- Changing treasury rates
- Changes in reinsurance


# 3. Stochastic reserve (SR) 

- Aggregate CTE 70 greatest present value of accumulated deficiencies over a range of stochastic scenarios
- Liability cash flows based on same assumptions as DR
- All of the post-issue impacts for DR also apply
- Asset modeling is critical $\Rightarrow$ variations in assets across scenarios drives the reserve
- SR discount rate varies by scenario: $1.05 \times 1$-year treasury scenario rates


## VM-20 Reserve $=$ NPR + Excess Reserve $\pm$ Premiums Due or Deferred

- Excess Reserve $=\max (D R, S R)-N P R$
- Premiums Due or Deferred $=$ technical accounting adjustment based on the timing of policyholder premiums (not important for LP)

Presentation note: It is important to always express the final reserve in terms of the NPR + the excess as shown above (e.g. don't just report the total $S R$ if $S R$ is the highest)

## Overview of Case Studies

The term and ULSG case studies focused on a single pricing scenario

- Did NOT consider pricing sensitivities and stochastic analysis


## 5 pricing situations were considered:

1. 2001 CSO valuation mortality, no financing

- Model 830 stat and tax reserves (XXX, AG 38)

2. 2001 CSO valuation with AG 48 Financing

- Model 830 stat and tax reserves (XXX, AG 38)
- Financed reserve $=$ Model 830 Reserve - VM-20

3. 2017 CSO valuation mortality, no financing

- Model 830 stat and tax reserves (XXX, AG 38)

4. 2017 CSO valuation mortality with AG 48 Financing

## Page 73
- Model 830 stat and tax reserves (XXX, AG 38)
- Financed reserve $=$ Model 830 Reserve - VM-20

5. 2017 CSO valuation mortality based on VM-20

- VM-20 stat reserves
- Tax reserve $=$ NPR

In summary:

- Situations 2 and 4 assume the insurer finances the Model 830 (XXX) reserve in excess of the VM-20 reserve
- Situations 1 and 3 assume the insurer holds the full Model 830 reserve without any financing help
- The only difference in Situations $1 \& 2$ vs. $3 \& 4$ is the mortality assumption, which affects both the Model 830 reserve and the NPR of the VM-20 reserve
- Situation 5 assumes the insurer holds a stat reserve based on the new PBR method in VM20 under 2017 CSO (no financing either)

The assumed financing cost was 75 bps and 100 bps for term and ULSG, respectively

# 3 profit methods were considered: 

1. Profit margin (pre-tax and after-tax)
2. Surplus strain (a.k.a. new business strain in other readings)
3. IRR based on distributable earnings (a.k.a. ROI in other readings)

Note: Directionally, all profit measures moved similarly. In other words, the pricing situation with the best IRR also had the best (lowest) surplus strain.

## Other Assumptions in the Case Study

- Pricing Economic Scenario - begins with U.S. Treasury rates as of December 31, 2015, then grades to a long-term expectation over 3 years
- Development of Treasury Rates for the DR and SR Scenarios
- Assumed term passed the stochastic exclusion test, but ULSG did not ${ }^{40}$
- Developed 200 stochastic scenarios for ULSG


## - Reserve Modeling Approach

- "Node" = each future time step where reserve calculations are performed
- NPR = closed-form solution prescribed in VM-20

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{40}$ If a product passes the stochastic exclusion test under VM-20, the company does not have to calculate the SR.

## Page 74
- DR assumptions before node $=$ pricing assumptions
- DR assumptions after node $=$ prudent estimates
- SR uses nested stochastic calculation at each node (complex and required various approximations)
- "Inner loop" assumptions = assumptions used to calculate reserves at each node
- "Outer loop" assumptions = projection assumptions based on pricing assumptions


# - Discount Rates and Asset Modeling 

- The authors used a spreadsheet model to develop discount rates separately for term and ULSG based on assets supporting each
- SR asset modeling more precisely reflected asset-liability cash flows than DR


## - Mortality Assumptions

- Prudent estimate assumption = mortality based on company experience with margins, grading to industry mortality with margins as outlined in VM-20
- Assumed 100\% credibility of company experience
- At future val dates, pricing mortality was assumed up through the val date
- Assumed mortality improvement in pricing assumptions up through each node but not beyond a node since VM-20 does not allow future mortality improvement in the reserve calculation


## - Reinsurance

- Assumed non-guaranteed YRT reinsurance in the DR and SR calculations
- YRT premiums set at $110 \%$ of VM-20 mortality
* This results in reinsurance premiums that rise as VM-20 grades from company experience to (higher) industry experience in the projection (hence why they are "non-guaranteed")
- First-year allowance = first year-year YRT premium (i.e. no reinsurance premium charged in first year)
- VM-20 requires each company should reflect counterparty actions that could impact modeled cash flows
* Reinsurer's right to increase non-guaranteed YRT rates or coinsurance allowances
* Recapture by ceding company
* Termination by reinsurer if treaty allows
* Reinsurer's pricing of premiums for new business based on existing business

## Page 75
Despite the technical nuances with reinsurance and VM-20 described in the paper, the reinsurance assumed by the authors did not have a meaningful impact on results because this phase of the research focused on very large insurers with high retention limits. The low band products were not affected at all since the 350K face amount was well under the 1 million retention limit.

# Term Case Studies 

The authors analyzed 4 hypothetical term products:

1. 10-year low face amount (350K)
2. 10-year high face amount ( 1.2 MM$)$
3. 20-year low face amount (350K) (not on syllabus)
4. 20-year high face amount (1.2MM) (not on syllabus)

## Pricing Situation Results for Term

Pricing situation 2 shows higher IRRs than pricing situation 1 because situation 2 involves tax benefits

- The tax and stat reserves in situation 1 are the same, so there is no additional tax benefit
- To finance the excess reserve in situation 2, the insurer cedes the excess reserve to a captive reinsurer
- This allows the insurer to take a reserve credit (lowering the net stat reserve held)
- However the tax reserve is based on the full Model 830 reserve allowing a larger tax deduction
- Therefore, after-tax earnings are higher for situation 2 vs. 1
- The effect is greatest in the early years, shifting more distributable earnings to early years

Pricing situation 3's profits are slightly higher than situation 1 because 2017 CSO mortality lowers reserves overall

- However situation 2 is still much better than situation 3 due to situation 2's heavy tax benefits

Pricing situation 4's relationship to situation 3 is similar to 2's relationship to 1

- Financing creates tax benefits that improve situation 4's profits over situation 3
- However since tax reserves are lower under 2017 CSO mortality, the increase in IRR is not as pronounced as going from 1 to 2
- Situation 2 is still best since the tax benefits are more pronounced when reserve levels are higher

Pricing situation 5's profits are between situation 3 and 4 (closest to 3)

## Page 76
- The NPR was the prevailing VM-20 reserve in all years, which maximized tax efficiency within situation 5
- Situation 5 (implementing VM-20) increases after-tax profits compared to situation 1
- In other words, non-financed products should see higher profits
- Situation 2 remains the profitable of all: optimal combination of low reserve mortality and high tax benefits resulting from reserve financing
- But this won't be an option in the future since VM-20 will be required


# Situation 5 Sensitivities Performed for Term 

Keep in mind situation 5 is really the "final" situation insurers will end up in since VM-20 will be required, so it makes sense to further explore sensitivities here

1. Mortality improvement assumed in pricing is not realized

- Project DR without mortality improvement
- Pre-tax profit margin is unchanged
- After-tax profit margins slightly lower due to some loss of tax efficiency
- Key point: tax efficiency is maximized when VM-20 reserve $=$ NPR
- If $\max (D R, S R)>N P R$, the stat reserve would be greater than the tax reserve, which is always the NPR (this would be less tax efficient)
- Removing the mortality improvement in the projected reserve causes the DR > NPR in a few early years

2. Assume discount rates set at pricing are used in all future periods (never updated)

- Very little impact on the term products because NPR is prevailing (remember the NPR's discount rates don't change anyway-only the DR and SR's can)
- Key point: to the extent that $\max (D R, S R)>N P R$, discount rate changes will have a larger impact on reserves (thus profits)
- This does apply to the ULSG product that we will see in a moment

3. Reduce gross premium by $10 \%$

- Has the largest impact on profits (cuts the IRR in half)
- Reducing the premium reduces positive cash flow and also increases the DR
- Key point: since the DR is a gross premium valuation (PV Ben - PV Prem), lower premiums will increase the DR


## Key Effects that Drive Results from Situation to Situation

This list does not appear explicitly in the reading. It's more of a key takeaway list from everything we've covered so far.

## Page 77
1. Tax benefits (biggest driver by far) - the larger tax reserves are relative to the net stat reserve (after reinsurance, financing, etc.), the higher after-profits will be

- This opportunity will be greatly reduced or eliminated after VM-20

2. 2017 CSO mortality - results in generally lower overall reserves than 2001 CSO and this increases profits

- Introducing 2017 CSO reduces the peak reserve by $1 / 3$ compared to 2001 CSO

3. VM-20 methodology - to the extent that $\max (\mathrm{NPR}, \mathrm{DR}, \mathrm{SR})<$ Model 830 reserves, profits will increase due to lower overall reserves

- Introducing VM-20 reduces the reserve peak by another $40 \%$ compare to a 2017 CSO Model 830 reserve
- VM-20 also shifts the reserve peak slightly farther into the future


# ULSG Case Studies 

The authors analyzed 350K and 1.2MM face amount shadow design ULSG products
"Shadow design" means there are essentially 2 account values: a normal AV available on surrender and a shadow $A V$ that has a more favorable set of charges and interest credits. As long as the shadow account > 0 , the policy will stay in force (even if the CSV $<0$ ).

## Comparing the ULSG results with the term results

- ULSG's profit measures are lower than term for any given pricing situation
- ULSG's profit measures generally moved in the same direction as the term products' for all pricing situations
- One exception: 2017 CSO mortality in situation 3 slightly reduced IRR compared to 2001 CSO mortality in situation 1 because an increase deficiency reserves caused the stat reserve to not fall by much
- Caveat: The hypothetical term products did not generate deficiency reserves like the ULSG product, but this may just be because of the specific facts/assumptions in the case study. I would be careful when generalizing some of the more "nuanced" results here to all cases.
- The change in pricing measures (e.g. after-tax IRR) was more muted for ULSG as compared to term
- While situation 5 (implementing VM-20) increases after-tax profits for low face ULSG compared to situation 1, it actually (slightly) reduces after-tax profits compared to situation 1 for the high band product
- Implementing VM-20 increased after-tax profits for all term products compared to situation 1
- The only difference between the high and low face ULSG products were expense charges in the shadow account, but these, too, were a result of case study decisions that may or may not resemble all cases in the real world.

## Page 78
# Situation 5 Sensitivities Performed for ULSG 

The same "no mortality improvement in DR" and "DR discount rates don't change" sensitivities were performed for ULSG

- The mortality improvement sensitivity had a very minor impact on profits
- The DR discount rate sensitivity had a more substantial (negative) impact compared to term because the DR played a larger role in the VM-20 reserve
- Remember the NPR was the prevailing VM-20 reserve for term


## Comparisons Between Term and ULSG VM-20 Reserves

- While the NPR was the prevailing VM-20 term reserve, the DR played a bigger role for ULSG
- The SR produced a slight excess over the DR in early durations for ULSG as well
- Variability in scenario results is highest in early durations before material assets backing the ULSG products build up
- Overall, the SR is not very prevalent for ULSG
- ULSG CSVs are typically low, so there isn't much variability in surrender benefits from scenario to scenario
- ULSG lapse rates tend to very low (lower than term)
- This drives the ULSG's DR higher due to higher benefits in the future "tail period" when assumed mortality has graded from company experience to (higher) industry mortality
- Note that the authors did not assume any mortality improvement to industry mortality, but they allude to the fact that other companies may indeed assume it (which would change the outcome)


## Key Conclusions for ULSG

- As with term, VM-20 is likely to lower after-tax profits for insurers who were using reserve financing
- It is possible that future ULSG products will be less complex since the current product complexity was driven by the need for relief from AG 38 reserves
- Simpler ULSG designs would also lessen risks from loss of key persons, sales training, and admin system complexities


## Observations and Other Commentary

## Dealing with Aggregate Level Reserves

Pricing is conventionally done at a cell level, which is straightforward with traditional stat reserves

## Page 79
Cell-level calculations are also possible for the NPR and DR

- The DR could be run on a seriatim basis and compared to the NPR policy by policy

Key challenge: the SR is done at an aggregate level (many policies run together along with asset portfolios)

- Therefore, pricing actuaries will need a way to allocate aggregate SRs to the cell level
- More of a concern for ULSG since ULSG is more likely to have material SRs than term
- Allocation decisions must be made carefully since they could cause some cells to be less competitive


# Reinsurance Timing Considerations 

Reinsurers are likely to increase robustness of pricing after VM-20

- Will also become more time consuming

Direct companies will likely want to know the reinsurer's pricing as early as possible so it can be folded into the direct pricing

## Underwriting Changes

The shift from traditional medical underwriting to data-driven underwriting may create uncertainty the mortality assumption used in VM-20 until credible experience emerges

## Impact on Product Premiums

Smaller companies may not have enough credibility to take advantage of the lower VM-20 reserves resulting from using (lower) credible company experience

Therefore, large companies may gain a higher competitive advantage from VM-20
However, there are many factors that will vary from company to company

## Impact on Product Design

Future product design should focus on managing product-specific risk more than formulaic reserve requirements

ULSG will likely see more product design changes than term

## Future ULSG designs may emphasize the accumulation value more

- Higher accumulation products would be less lapse supported than today's ULSG

Higher accumulation values would lower VM-20 reserves for 2 reasons:

1. Increases incentive to surrender, which would justify higher assumed lapse rates
2. Defers or eliminates the prescribed grading for minimally funding policies

- VM-20 requires grading to a low ultimate T100 lapse rate for minimally funded policies

## Page 80
Companies may offer other incentives on ULSG to cause the policyholder to surrender before the mortality grading occurs (e.g. ROP)

# Pricing Systems Changes That May Be Needed 

1. Ability to project deterministic scenarios from an assumed baseline Treasury curve
2. Ability to determine earned rates at each future scenario node
3. Nested stochastic calculations/approximations for each of the points above

# LPM-155: Understanding Profitability in Life Insurance 

Source Author: Swiss Re (January 2012)

## Overview of This Reading

This paper gives an overview of the evolution of insurance profit metrics from traditional accounting-based measures to more market-consistent measures

This reading pairs well with sources of earnings and MCEV concepts covered in other readings

## Key topics for the exam include:

- Accounting-based profitability indicators ( 9 total): advantages and disadvantages of each
- Have a feel for trends in profitability indicators from 2000-2010
- Market-consistent embedded value
- MCEV earnings analysis
- 6 MCEV-based profitability indicators
- Primary sources of earnings for insurers


## Introduction

The original purpose of life insurance was death protection, but now insurers offer products covering disability, critical illness, LTC, and retirement savings

Life insurance premiums make up a huge chunk of world GDP (4\%)
Understanding life insurance profitability is important to investors, policyholders, regulators, and management

Life insurance profits must be measured with a long-term mindset
The industry is trying to move away from short-term, accounting-based profitability indicators to more long-term measures like market-consistent embedded value

## Historic Trends in Life Profitability

Life insurance total shareholder return has generally been higher than the broader market the last 10 years

## Indicators Used to Judge Life Insurance Performance

1. Book Value Per Share $=$ Book Value $/$ Total Shares

- Book Value $=$ Assets - Liabilities $=$ Shareholder Equity
- GAAP BVs have increased significantly for life insurers in the last 10 years
- Since most of the increase was driven by declining interest rates, book value may be misleading

## Page 82
2. Price-to-Book Ratio $=$ Share Price $/$ Book Value Per Share

- Share values have fallen behind book values
- The financial crisis has made investors more pessimistic about life insurers even though insurers faired well in the crisis

3. Return on Equity (ROE)

- Closely related to price-to-book ratios
- Companies with high ROEs typically have high price-to-book ratios
- ROE has been more volatile than book value per share

4. Operating Margin $=$ Operating Profits / Premiums

- Declined less than ROE during 2001-2002 recession but fell much more during the 2008 crisis


# Summary of Life Insurance Company Values Last 10 Years 

1. Book values have risen substantially
2. Market values have fallen
3. ROE hasn't changed much end-to-end over the period but has been very volatile
4. Operating margins dipped sharply during the crisis but have rebounded to previous levels (very little net change last 10 years)
5. Operating margin and ROE have followed a similar pattern given that the ROE numerator is profit

## Benefits and Limits of Accounting-Based Profitability Measures

Key advantage: rely on public information

## Disadvantages:

- Statutory accounting focuses more on solvency than realistic income
- Rules vary a lot from country to country (or region)
- Some measures are volatile if based on GAAP and IFRS earnings
- Poor at comparing new and existing business
- Not usually meaningful at the product level
- Assumptions are locked in, so experience deviations are missed
- No accounting for cost of capital

Investors may devalue insurance stocks due to limitations in current profitability measures

## Accounting-Based Profitability Indicators

## Page 83
Benefits Ratio $=($ Policyholder Benefits + Changes in Reserves $) /($ Premiums + Other Charges and Income)

- Advantages: Measures mortality/morbidity; easy to understand
- Disadvantages: May be misleading since life insurance costs are long-term

Lapse Ratio $=($ Lapsed Policies or Face $) /($ In-Force Policies or Face $)$

- Advantage: indicates net persistency
- Disadvantages: May not accurately reflect timing

General Expense Ratio $=($ General Operating Expenses $) /($ Net Premiums $)$

- Advantages: compare different companies' expenses and efficiencies
- Disadvantages: Meaningful only for comparing similar business

Operating Margin $=($ Operating Profit $) /($ Net Premiums $)$

- Advantage: Easy to compare life products
- Disadvantages: Doesn't reflect timing of cash flows, cost of capital, or riskiness

Return on Equity (ROE) $=($ Shareholder Profits $) /($ Shareholder Equity $)$

- Advantages: Well understood; calculated by all public companies
- Disadvantages: Meaningful only at the portfolio level

Return on Assets (ROA) $=($ Profit $) /($ Total Company Assets $)$

- Advantages: Easy to calculate; common for deferred annuities
- Disadvantages: Not suited for products with mortality risk; may be volatile

Net Investment Result $=$ Total Investment Gains - Impairments

- Advantages: Shows an important source of earnings for life insurers
- Disadvantages: Not useful for lines where investment income is insignificant


# Measuring Profitability with Market-Consistent Embedded Value (MCEV) 

Assets are held at a trading value, while non-traded liabilities are valued using replicating portfolios

MCEV $=$ Value of In-Force (VIF) + Required Capital + Free Surplus
VIF $=$ PV Future Profits - Value of Options and Guarantees - Cost of Non-Hedgeable Risks Frictional Cost of Required Capital

Required Capital $=\mathrm{MV}$ capital allocated to support business (e.g. rating target)
Free Surplus $=\mathrm{MV}$ any extra allocated capital not needed to support business

## Page 84
VIF is sensitive to assumption changes, so sensitivities should be performed to increase investor understanding

MCEV has asymmetric interest rate risk because the cost of guarantees rises sharply when interest rates rate fall

- -100 bps interest rate change $=-9 \%$ change in MCEV
- +100 bps interest rate change $=+3 \%$ change in MCEV

Mortality and morbidity risks are more symmetric with plus/minus shocks, so natural hedges are possible

Earnings analyses are useful for showing how MCEV changes period to period by component:

1. MCEV of new business added
2. Unwinding of MCEV on existing business

- Planned roll-forward of discounting
- Interest on required capital and surplus
- Expected investment income
- Expected release of non-hedgeable costs

3. Experience (past) variances and assumption (forward-looking) updates
4. Economic variances

- Changes in economic variable beyond the company's control (e.g. interest rates)


# Important MCEV-Based Profitability Indicators 

## MCEV (itself)

- Advantages: Accurately measures long-term company or line value; harmonized methodology
- Disadvantages: Can be volatile; may be viewed as a black box by investors


## MCEV Earnings Analysis

- Advantages: Understand drivers of MCEV changes
- Disadvantages: Can be volatile


## VIF

- Advantages: Expresses book value net of relevant costs
- Disadvantages: Can be volatile


## Value of New Business (VNB)

- Advantages: Understand new business's contribution to company value

## Page 85
- Disadvantages: May be overly optimistic

New Business Margin $=$ VNB $/($ NB Premiums)

- Advantages: Compare against expected profit margins
- Disadvantages: May be overly optimistic

Return on MCEV = (MCEV Earnings) / MCEV

- Advantages: Complements ROE reporting
- Disadvantages: May be overly optimistic

MCEV has struggled to gain traction since it was unveiled around the time of the crisis, and abnormally high volatility distorted the values

MCEV remains predominantly supplementary reporting tools for companies that use them
New standards like Solvency II, the Swiss Solvency Test, and IFRS may eliminate the need for MCEV since they also use market-consistent approaches

# Zooming in on Product Performance 

Different life insurance products protect policyholders against different risks

- Life or disability products with little or no cash value expose insurer to mortality, morbidity, and lapse risks
- Life products with cash value may involve the above risks plus interest rate and equity market risk
- Annuity and investment products may only involve lapse, interest rate, and equity market risk


## Primary Sources of Earnings for Insurers

1. Underwriting Results

- Driven by experience from premiums, claims, reserve changes, and expenses
- Important for term life and payout annuities
- Factors that affect earnings:
- Catastrophic mortality events
- Asymmetric information about policyholder health
- Adverse selection and moral hazard
- Higher-than-expected lapses
- Frequent product churning

2. Investment Results

## Page 86
- Important for payout annuities
- Factors that affect earnings
- Insurer's asset allocation
- Market performance
- Level of guarantees
- Investment management skills
- Extent that losses are shared with policyholder
- Duration mismatch

3. Fee Income from Policyholder Investment Management

- Important for unit-linked savings products
- Factors that affect earnings
- Financial market volatility
- Policyholder behavior

A companies mix of the above 3 sources determines its earnings profile
Companies that rely more on underwriting results have provide more stable income recently than companies that rely on investment and fee income

# Products Targeted at Retirement Market Sidebar 

1. More flexible product structures that can be sold à la carte
2. More single-premium unit-linked products (e.g. VAs)
3. More guarantees sold with VAs (e.g. GMDB, GLWB)

## Overview of This Reading

This is a very large study note in terms of testability; it is rich with quantitative, conceptual, and listy topics that could be tested

Perhaps the most fundamental thing to understand from this reading is that economic methods are designed to link profits to insurance risk, not investment risk

## Key topics for the exam include:

- Shortcomings of traditional measurement systems
- How and why insurers can "borrow" cheaply to create value
- Base cost of capital
- Frictional costs - both from the shareholders' and insurer's perspective
- Franchise value
- How to create a replicating portfolio and how it changes through time
- How to calculate the economic value of liabilities
- How to calculate economic profit
- Why economic profit is immune to interest rate changes
- How emerging insurance experience affects economic profit
- The purpose of the treasury function
- Considerations for incentive compensation
- Problems with alternative methods like embedded value

Note: The video lesson series in the online course includes extensive numerical examples to illustrate key concepts in this chapter. Going through those examples is critical to fully understanding the framework in this study note, which often intimidates people at first. The good news is that once you master a few fundamentals, it's actually not that bad!

## Page 88
# Introduction: Why Economic Capital? 

## Prerequisites for Maximizing Shareholder Value

1. Understand the value creation process
2. Ability to measure value creation
3. Incentive systems that align management interests with value creation

## How the Insurance Industry is Changing

Until the 1990s, competition was low and profit margins were high
Changes in the 1990s:

- Deregulation and globalization
- Increased competition from inside and outside the industry (banking)
- Higher competition $\rightarrow$ lower profit margins $\rightarrow$ higher volumes now required
- Increased value awareness across the industry


## Shortcomings of Artificial Value Measurement Systems

"Artificial" - traditional, non-economic approaches

1. Mask true value in a company
2. Mislead managers about key risks
3. Vary greatly across product lines and countries $\rightarrow$ comparisons are difficult
4. Overly conservative

- Leads to "hidden reserves"
- Allows companies to smooth/control profit emergence (U.S. GAAP)
- Smoothing masks volatility and true economic condition
- May hide the need for corrective actions


## The Economic Perspective

Assets should be valued at market values
Liability cash flows should be valued using best estimates and time value of money

## How Insurers Are Financial Intermediaries

## 1. Liability-Driven Financial Intermediaries

Borrow money from policyholders (premiums)
Invest premiums in financial markets

## Page 89
Pay benefits to policyholders if claim event occurs
2. Reduce Policyholder's Credit Exposure

Insurers hold extra capital to reduce risk of default (from policyholder's perspective)

# How Insurers Differ From Leveraged Investment Funds 

1. Competitive Disadvantage with Investing

Less favorable tax and regulatory environment
Double taxation (more on this later)
2. Insurers Can Borrow More Cheaply

It's cheaper to borrow from policyholders than in capital markets
Insurers can sell policies for more than their economic cost
Policyholders are willing to pay for protection

## How Insurers Create Value

1. Selling contracts for more than the production and frictional costs
2. Achieving investment returns greater than base CoC benchmark

Franchise value = intangible part of a company's market value that represents expected value from future business
$=$ Total Company Market Value - Economic Net Worth
In other words, a company is worth more to investors than simply taking the difference between current assets and current liabilities

## Cost of Capital (CoC) for Insurers

Investors (shareholders) can invest in an insurance company or in some other investment opportunity

Total Opportunity Cost of Capital $=$ Base CoC + Frictional Costs + Liquidity Value + Option to Default Value

Base CoC $=$ Benchmark Return on Investment Portfolio - Replicating Portfolio Return
I.e. the premium required if shareholders invested directly in the assets held by the insurer Do not use CAPM because it doesn't capture frictional costs

## Liquidity Value and Option to Default

## 1. Insurer's Option to Default

Insolvent insurers may default on liabilities

## Page 90
Cost is based on credit spread resulting from insurer's rating
Add the extra spread to the risk-free rate rate used in the EVL calculation

# 2. Liquidity Value 

Insurers may choose to hold less liquid assets if they can hold them to maturity
Higher yield on illiquid assets lowers the production value
Add the extra liquidity spread to the risk-free rate rate used in the EVL calculation

## Frictional Capital Costs

Frictional capital costs $=$ costs specific to investing in an insurer

## 1. Agency Costs

Shareholders require compensation for lack of transparency and control
Insurance companies are less transparent than other investments a shareholder could make
Insurance company may not act in the shareholders' best interest
Cost ranges from 5-200 bps of capital held

## 2. Cost of Financial Distress

Shareholders require extra return for the company-specific risk of ruin (insolvency)
Cost ranges from 10-20\% of market value (shouldn't exceed franchise value)

## 3. Regulatory Restriction Costs

Cost of holding extra regulatory capital that can't be used for other purposes (like a liquidity risk)
Cost ranges from 0-200 bps of restricted capital

## 4. Double Taxation on Investment Income

Insurer's investment income is taxed when it flows through earnings, then it gets taxed again when distributed to shareholders
Cost $=$ Tax Rate $\times$ Taxable Income
Taxable income includes effects of statutory/tax reserve changes and the total investment income on capital

Try to make yourself look at all of this from the shareholder's perspective. As an investor, you want to know that the return for your investment is consistent with the risks taken. By choosing to invest in an insurance company, you need to be compensated for these insurance-company-specific frictional costs that aren't found in alternative investments.

## The Replicating Portfolio

The portfolio that matches the best estimate of future liability cash flows
Provides cash flows to pay claims, expenses, and capital costs

## Page 91
"Produces the liability"
Value of liabilities $=$ market value of replicating portfolio
Best estimate liability cash flows are easily replicated with risk-free assets
The risk in "pure insurance" (e.g. term life) best estimate cash flows is non-systemic and can be diversified away by shareholders

Products with interest rate risk have systemic risk (cannot be diversified away)
Requires more sophisticated hedging
Replication Risk - Inability to find a portfolio that replicates liability cash flows (e.g. liabilities too long)

Treated as a frictional cost

# Calculating the Economic Value of Liabilities (EVL) 

1. Project liability cash flows (premiums, claims, expenses, etc.)
2. Project frictional costs
3. Calculate net liability cash flow at each future point in time

Net $\mathrm{CF}=$ Premiums - Claims - Expenses - Frictional Costs
4. $\mathrm{EVL}=\mathrm{PV}(\mathrm{Net} \mathrm{CF})$ at risk-free rate

The EVL is based on risk-free rates because the cash flows can be replicated with risk-free assets
Buy zero-coupon bonds to match years with negative net CF
Borrow (short) zero-coupon bonds to match years with positive net CF
EVL = Market Value of Long Bonds - Market Value of Short Bonds
EVL Example

| Year | Premiums | Claims | Expenses | Frictional Costs | Net CF |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 0 | 100 |  | 87 | 0 | 13 |
| 1 | 100 | 50 | 5 | 2 | 43 |
| 2 |  | 50 | 5 | 2 | -57 |

The company will receive 43 in year 1 and will have to pay out 57 in year 2
Build a replicating portfolio:
Buy zero-coupon bonds maturing for 57 in 2 years
Short zero-coupon bonds maturing for 43 in year 1
The long 2-year bonds will fund the net liability payment in year 2, and the borrowed 1-year bonds will be repaid with the positive cash flow in year 1

## Page 92
Assume the risk-free rate is $3 \%$ all years:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{EVL}_{0} & =-\frac{43}{1.03}+\frac{57}{1.03^{2}} \\
& =-41.75+53.73 \\
& =11.98
\end{aligned}
$$

This is the net market value of the risk-free replicating portfolio at time 0

# Economic Profit and IRR 

## Economic Profit at Issue

Economic Profit $=$ Net CF - Change in EVL
From the previous example:

$$
\text { Economic Profit at Issue }=13-11.98=1.02
$$

In other words, the company collected 13 upfront but only had to spend 11.98 to set up the replicating portfolio

The IRR of the cash flows is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
13 & =-\frac{43}{1+\mathrm{IRR}}+\frac{57}{(1+\mathrm{IRR})^{2}} \\
\mathrm{IRR} & =1.44 \%
\end{aligned}
$$

The IRR is the company's cost of borrowing from the policyholder along with the cost of other expenses and frictional costs

Since the company borrowed at a rate of $1.44 \%$, then invested in assets yielding $3 \%$, the company earned a spread of $1.56 \%$

This illustrates the 2nd way that insurers differ from leveraged investment funds: the borrowing advantage

IRR is a fickle animal, especially if the cash flow signs switch a lot. As such, the authors recommend focusing on the absolute economic profit. However, in simple cases like the one above, you might be asked to calculate it on the exam.

## Economic Profit After Issue

At issue, expected economic profit in future periods is zero because the change in EVL is exactly offset by the cash flows and investment return

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Economic Profit }_{t}= & \text { Net CF After Frictional Costs }_{t} \\
& +\operatorname{InvReturn}_{t}-\left(\mathrm{EVL}_{t}-\mathrm{EVL}_{t-1}\right) \\
\operatorname{InvReturn}_{t}= & r \times \mathrm{EVL}_{t-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Page 93
This is really the same formula used above at issue; it's just that there's no InvReturn at issue.
Continuing the example, now one year after issue:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{EVL}_{1} & =\frac{57}{1.03}=55.34 \\
\operatorname{InvReturn}_{1} & =0.03 \times 11.98=0.36 \\
\Delta \mathrm{EVL}_{1} & =55.34-11.98=43.36 \\
\text { Economic Profit }_{1} & =\underbrace{43}_{\text {Net CF }}+\underbrace{0.36}_{\text {InvReturn }}-\underbrace{43.36}_{\Delta \mathrm{EVL}}=0
\end{aligned}
$$

Since the replicating portfolio produces a cash flow pattern that is the mirror image of the liability cash flow pattern, everything perfectly offsets.

# Immunity to Interest Rate Changes 

If the risk-free rate changes, it has no effect on economic profit

- The change in InvReturn is exactly offset by the change in EVL
- InvReturn $=3 \%$ interest on previous EVL $+\Delta$ EVL due to interest rate shift

Suppose the risk-free drops to $2 \%$ at time 1 :

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{EVL}_{1} & =\frac{57}{1.02}=55.88 \\
\operatorname{InvReturn}_{1} & =0.03 \times 11.98+(55.88-55.34) \\
& =0.36+0.54=0.90 \\
\Delta \mathrm{EVL}_{1} & =55.88-11.98=43.90 \\
\text { Economic Profit }_{1} & =\underbrace{43}_{\text {No Change }}+\underbrace{0.90}_{0.54 \text { higher }}-\underbrace{43.90}_{0.54 \text { higher }}=0
\end{aligned}
$$

The replicating portfolio has a higher InvReturn because rates dropped (i.e. the bonds appreciated), but now the final liability cash flow of 57 is discounted by lower rate as well

## Impact of Different Insurance Experience

If cash flows end up different than expected, economic profit $\neq 0$

## Page 94
Suppose the claims in year 1 are 55 instead of 50 (but the risk-free rate hasn't changed):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{NetCF}_{1} & =100-55-5-2=38<43 \\
\operatorname{InvReturn}_{1} & =0.03 \times 11.98=0.36(\text { no effect }) \\
\operatorname{EVL}_{1} & =\frac{57}{1.03}=55.34(\text { no effect }) \\
\Delta \operatorname{EVL}_{1} & =55.34-11.98=43.36(\text { no effect }) \\
\text { Economic Profit }_{1} & =\underbrace{38}_{5 \text { lower }}+\underbrace{0.36}_{\text {Same as before }}-\underbrace{43.36}_{\text {Same as before }}=-5
\end{aligned}
$$

Economic profit is designed to capture the impact of insurance experience

# Treasury Function and Transfer Pricing 

A company could set up a treasury function to attribute performance to underwriting (insurance) decisions vs. investments decisions

Total Profit $=$ Insurance Profit + Investments Profit
The treasury function determines the benchmark total return for the investment unit of the company

The treasury function:

1. Borrows assets equal to the replicating portfolio from the underwriting function
2. Loans assets equal to total capital to the investments function at a rate equal to the benchmark return

By specifying the benchmark return, the treasury function effectively determines the base CoC
When actual investment returns are earned on capital, the investments function pays the treasury interest on the loan

If the benchmark return for $\$ 100$ million of capital is $7 \%$, and the actual return is $8 \%$, then the investment function contributed $\$ 1$ million to economic profit

In the end, the goal is to simply isolate economic profit caused by investment experience to the investments function, not the insurance function. The insurance function's investment return on the replicating portfolio should not impact economic profit since the roll-forward of the replicating portfolio should be offset by cash flows-and if it's not, it is because of insurance experience, not investments experience (see previous examples above).

## Performance Attribution Analysis

Economic profit can be further analyzed within insurance and investments functions
Insurance attribution analysis should separate out:

- Impact of new business

## Page 95
- Deviations from expected experience

Investments attribution analysis should separate out:

- Asset allocation effects
- Currency selection
- Stock selection
- Sector selection


# Setting Economic Value Targets 

- If actual economic profit > expected economic profit, share prices increases
- Should be based on long-term interest rates
- Consider impact of new business
- Benchmark against other companies


## Incentive Compensation

- Should be linked directly to economic value creation
- Should reward good decisions on an ex ante basis (before risks are realized)

Challenge: Most performance can only be measured ex post

- Should not give managers a free put option

Should react to downside risk as well as upside
Deferral systems can be used for low frequency / high severity risks

- Don't based incentives solely on economic profit for high risk business with extreme swings

Suggested approach:

1. Set a baseline target bonus
2. Increase or decrease bonus based on manager or business unit's performance

## Problems with Non-Economic Other Methods

1. Embedded Value $=$ inforce value (PV of stat profits discounted at insurer's cost of capital) + market value of stat shareholder capital

- Biased toward higher-yielding assets
- Ignores frictional costs other than regulatory restrictions
- Regulatory capital charges are highest for lowest yielding assets

## Page 96
- Does not easily accommodate options and guarantees

2. Risk-Adjusted Return on Capital (RAROC)

RAROC $=$ PV(Economic Profit) $/$ (Risk Capital)

- Assumes all capital costs are proportionate to economic capital
- Hurdle rate is based on CAPM, which ignores frictional costs
- Only considers capital in first year
- Discounts expected returns at the expected earned rate
- Creates incentives to take investment risk

Source Author: Swiss Re (June 2017)

## Overview of This Reading

This paper describes various ways insurers can increase the profitability of in-force (existing) business

This paper is written for a European audience, but there are a lot of general takeaways for US and Canadian insurers

This paper basically reduces to an outline of 6 "levers" that insurers can use to increase the profitability of their in-force blocks. I would be able to list all 6 levers as well as detail under each. There is honestly not a lot of depth to this paper, which mentions a lot of topics at a very high level. A number of these topics are covered in greater detail elsewhere on the syllabus, however.

## Key topics for the exam:

- Factors that have strained life insurers' profits
- Know the 6 levers and detail/examples of each:

1. Steering liability portfolios to support strategic ambitions and financial targets

- How to apply a holistic in-force steering framework
- Re-designing products and developing services
- Cross- and up-selling
- Methods for dealing with unprofitable books

2. Improving persistency ( 7 items)
3. Improving claims management (6 items)
4. Adjusting asset management subject to regulatory constraints and risk appetite

- Key challenges that affect life insurers' investment income
- Asset strategies
- Strategies to increase asset yield
- Adapting to new regulatory frameworks

5. Optimizing capital

- Methods for stabilizing cash flows and earnings
- Methods for freeing up trapped capital

6. Increasing operational efficiency (reducing costs)

- Way to modernize the IT landscape
- Possible ways of optimizing operations

## Page 98
# Executive Summary 

Life insurers are increasingly focusing on optimization of in-force business, not just creating new business

Factors that have strained life insurers' profits:

## 1. Low interest rate environment

- Hurts savings-type products, which generate the majority of premium income (85\%) in the global life insurance industry
- Lower fixed income asset returns make it harder to fund guarantees
- A spike in interest rates would also hurt: would trigger high lapses

2. Increased competition - price comparison websites, etc.
3. Increased regulatory pressure to show the true economic cost of insurance (Solvency II, IFRS 17$)^{41}$

In addition to changing product features and re-pricing products, insurers are beginning to use in-force management as a tool for improving profits

This article recommends 6 key areas ("levers") for improving in-force management

## Overview of 6 Levers for Effective In-Force Management

1-3.) Managing liabilities and improving consumer value

1. Steering liability portfolios to support strategic ambitions and financial targets

- Allocate capital to the most attractive products and LOBs

2. Improving persistency by providing a higher value to policyholders

- Product enhancements increase persistency

3. Improving claims management

- Be supportive of policyholders
- Claims demonstrate the value of insurance to insurers' clients
- Improve claims by encouraging healthier lifestyles

4. Adjusting asset management subject to regulatory constraints and the insurer's risk appetite

- Investment income contributes to profit and helps fund claims


## 5. Optimizing capital

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{41}$ This paper is written primarily for a European audience, so you'll see various references to Solvency II, which is more of a "market-consistent" economic capital framework for regulatory capital. Solvency II tends to penalize products that have more of an investment-orientation.

## Page 99
- Excessive capital increases economic costs
- Tools: reinsurance and capital market solutions

6. Increasing operational efficiency (reducing costs) on in-force operations

The remaining sections provide more detail on each lever

# Steering Liability Portfolios 

Involves allocating capital to the most attractive product types and business lines
Liability steering is similar to investment-decision making but more complex, requiring collaboration from multiple areas of the company

## Applying a Holistic In-Force Steering Framework

1. Set financial targets

- Accounting-based indicators: easy to understand but fail to capture long-term nature of business
- Positive cash flows may take years to materialize for traditional life insurance
- Short-term business (e.g. medical reimbursement) and unit-linked ${ }^{42}$ products provide a faster payback
- Economic value (EV) metrics: explicitly recognize relative riskiness and quantify future cash flows and cost of capital

2. Determine constraints

- Capacity limits, capital adequacy, required cash flows, risk appetite

3. Project future market conditions

- Requires assumptions for demand, competition, risk landscape, and regulation
- New technology: Big Data and machine learning
- Research on consumer preferences
- Measurement of consumer behavior
- Surveys on consumer preferences
- Discrete choice experiments can measure unconscious behavioral biases and aid new product development
- New sources of competition: financial services firms, Big Tech, and small niche players

4. Identify opportunities and rank by attractiveness
42 "Unit-linked" products are similar to what Americans call "variable" products and what Canadians call "segregated" products.

## Page 100
- Product design, customer retention, cross- and up-selling (organic growth), sale of business, M\&A, portfolio run-off

5. Specify target liability portfolio
6. Manage asset portfolio
7. Optimize capital structure
8. Verify that constraints are met

# Re-Designing Products and Developing Services 

1. Align product strategy to cope with changing market conditions

- Lower or abolish guaranteed benefits
- Align crediting rates with expected investment returns
- Shift interest rate and market risks to policyholders with unit-linked products
- Offer participating whole life (has not been popular)
- Reprice biometric risks (e.g. mortality) because low interest rates prevent sufficient reserves
- Reduce product complexity to appeal to online buyers

2. Prepare for rising interest rates

- When interest rates rises quickly, policyholders may shock lapse to purchase cheaper or more attractive products

3. Develop new services

- Adding more services improves consumer value (e.g. wearables for health monitoring and disease management)
- Will require collaboration with health care and technology providers


## Growing High-Performance Business Through Cross- and Up-Selling

- Cross-selling - selling a new product to an existing customer
- Up-selling - upgrading an existing customer's product
- Benefits:

1. Cross/up-sell when policyholder reports a claim
2. Reduce costs/prices by selecting good risks for cross/up-selling
3. Diversify underwriting risks

- Challenges:
- Fragmented IT systems and silo-ed organizations

## Page 101
- Demographic segmentation may be insufficient to identify consumer preferences


# Dealing With Unprofitable Books 

- Reducing the in-force risk profile
- Reasons costs have gone up: higher capital requirements and low interest rates
- 3 types of solutions (from least to most challenging):

1. Change non-guaranteed elements

* Lower dividends and crediting rates
* Increase fees and premiums

2. Exchange/conversion programs

* Convince policyholders to switch to policies with lower guarantees but higher return potential

3. Buyout programs - buy back unprofitable policies from customers

- Risks of exchange and buyout programs:

1. Adverse selection (anti-selection) - may cause profitable policyholders to lapse and unprofitable ones to persist
2. Reputational risk - policyholders feel pressured to terminate contracts

- Reasons policyholders may no longer want their policy:

1. No longer need income protection
2. Life expectancy has changed
3. Needs have changed

- Options to deal with unprofitable or non-core run-off business

1. Retain and run off to expiry

- Advantages
* Full control and profit retention
* No dependence on external providers
* No external fees
* Keep access to high-value customers
* Keep experience of current team
- Disadvantages
* Different skill set required
* Maintains exposure to future losses/volatility

## Page 102
* Operational inefficiencies due to a shrinking book
* Longest timeframe to liquidate liabilities

2. Outsource to a third-party administrator (TPA)

- Advantages
* TPA may be able to manage the business more efficiently
* Frees up resources
* Good option when business value is high
- Disadvantages
* Exposure to reputational risk (TPA may provide bad service)
* TPA fees may erode profits
* Maintains exposure to future losses/volatility

3. Reinsure with maintained or outsourced administration

- Advantages
* Limits exposure to future losses
* Provides capital relief
* Frees management to focus on the other LOBs
- Disadvantages
* Ceding company usually maintains contractual liability with policyholders
* 2 parties being in control limits full operational/capital synergies
* Introduces counterparty risk
* Policyholder approval required to allow reinsurer to assume all all contractual liabilities ${ }^{43}$
* Few reinsurers can assume all administrative functions

4. Sell block

- Advantages
* Quick and effective way to achieve early exit from business
* Capital can be redeployed to other lines
* Creates operational, capital, and tax efficiencies
- Disadvantages
* Highest up-front losses for the seller

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{43}$ They are alluding to assumption reinsurance here

## Page 103
* Might need approval from policyholder or regulator
* Buyer availability may be limited outside the US and UK


# Increasing Persistency 

- How high lapses hurt insurers:
- Acquiring new customers is $6-7 \mathrm{x}$ more costly than retaining an existing one
- Acquisition costs are not recouped
- Anti-selection (healthy lives lapse) can hurt mortality products
- Lower-than-expected ultimate lapses hurt lapse supported products
- Drivers of lapses
- Consumer-specific drivers:
* Needs change (new stage of life)
* Premiums lower on other products
* Lack of interaction between insurer and customer
* Advisors encouraging policy switching
- Market-specific drivers:
* High unemployment, falling income
* Spike in interest rates
- Response levers insurers can use to mitigate lapses
- Premium holidays to help with temporary affordability
- Offer discounts to match better offers
- Offer exchanges or alternative products if needs have changed
- Mitigating lapses on post-level term business
- US insurers have found that more gradual transitions to the ART period can reduce shock lapses
- Helping policyholders avoid negative behavioral biases
- Behavioral economics may shed light on why policyholders lapse
- Some insurers are managing persistency by studying consumers' evolving needs
- Improving lapse predictions with predictive analytics
- Life insurers have been slow to implement advanced data mining and predictive modeling techniques
- Propensity-to-lapse models have been largely unsuccessful to date

## Page 104
- This is a promising area for the future
- Increasing customer engagement
- Traditionally, insurers and customers interact mainly at the point of sale
- "Engaged and healthy customers keep their policies for longer"
- Smartphones, social media, etc. are making it easier to interact with customers
* Can explain why premiums have increased
* Can be used to promote healthier lifestyles


# Improving Claims Management 

An efficient claims management process provides a good experience for customers but also ensures only legit claims are paid

There are 6 levers for improving claims management

1. Increasing process efficiency

- M\&A can lead to fragmented infrastructures
- Avoid silos and poor communication between units
- Automation can increase efficiency

2. Enhancing claims experience

- Best case: easy, effective, timely claims settlement
- Start with a clear explanation of coverage when policy is sold
- Provide clear guidance on how to file claims
- Immediately inform policyholder if claim is not covered
- Offer appeals process for denied claims

3. Improving fraud prevention and detection

- Lowers claim costs and premiums
- Make customers aware of the consequences of fraud
- Putting a fraud notification at the top of a claims form is more effective than at the bottom
- Improve fraud detection with training and predictive modeling

4. Deep-dive on claims analytics

- Actuaries and data scientists could use claims data to enhance predictive modeling capabilities
- Claims analytics is improving in 2 ways:

## Page 105
1.) Easier and cheaper data collection
2.) Advances in predictive modeling and hardware
5. Supporting health recovery and job reintegration

- Employ clinical teams that help rehabilitate LTC/disability claimants
- Case management programs can have disease management and care support elements
- Requires collaboration with employers (e.g. giving employers incentives for successful reintegration)

6. Nudging health-related behaviors

- Examples:
- Text message reminders for appointments, medication, etc.
- Rewards for going to the gym
- Uses of behavioral economics:
- Communicate health advice from healthcare professionals instead of insurers
- Benchmark progress against peers
- Use default options that require consumers to opt out of health programs


# Managing Assets 

## Key Challenges That Affect Life Insurers' Investment Income

- Low interest rates
- Deviations in mortality and lapse experience
- Regulatory changes
- Reinvestment risk


## Asset Strategies Relevant for In-Force Books

1. Improve asset-liability duration match
2. Hedge investment risks with derivatives

## Strategies Insurers Have Used to Find Higher-Yielding Assets

1. Alternative investments (private equity, hedge funds)
2. Less liquid asset classes (real estate, infrastructure, and commercial mortgages)
3. Lower-rated bonds (e.g. BBB corporates)

## Page 106
4. Foreign securities (mainly done by Asia Pacific insurers)

# Adapting to New Regulatory Frameworks 

Changes in capital required by regulators requires insurers to reallocate assets

## Optimizing Capital

## Stabilizing Cash Flows and Earnings

- Transferring mortality and morbidity risks
- Proportional reinsurance (quota share) - can reduce mortality and morbidity risk
- Non-proportional reinsurance - excess-of-loss, stop-loss, etc. can transfer cat risk
- Capital market solutions (e.g. cat bonds) transfer cat risk to investors
* Uses a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to create a reinsurance agreement and issue bonds
* Investors suffer losses if a cat event occurs
- Transferring longevity risk on life annuities
- Indemnity-based reinsurance: ceding company pays fixed premiums to a (re)insurer and receives payments based on actual longevity experience
- Index-based reinsurance: linked to a population index instead of the actual experience of the reinsured block
- Some insurers are willing to accept longevity risk from other insurers to diversify mortality risk
- Transferring lapse risk
- Value-in-force (VIF) solutions - allow insurer to sell/reinsure embedded value (EV) to raise capital and improve solvency ratios
- Non-proportional lapse risk reinsurance - pays the ceding company if lapses are above a threshold


## Freeing Up Trapped Capital

- Efficient reserve financing
- XXX/AXXX excess reserve financing in the US had evolved from coinsurance to "soft" assets like letters of credit and credit-linked notes, then AG 48 put limitations on soft assets
- Principles-based reserves should reduce but not eliminate the need to finance excess reserves
- Increasing available capital and liquidity

## Page 107
- VIF monetizations can increase liquidity and provide capital for other uses
- VIF financing is called "Zinszusatzreserve" in Germany
- Selling a block is also an option


# Increasing Operational Efficiency 

## Modernizing the IT Landscape

- Overhauling the IT core system
- Reduces IT operation costs
- Smart applications can combine multiple data sources to train statistical-learning algorithms to support/replace human processes
- Increasing process automation
- Frees resources for other activities
- Digital reporting platforms allow policyholders to self-report claims
- Artificial intelligence (AI)
- Can improve everything from product design to post-sales service
- Can process natural language and perform sentiment analysis to assess customer concerns
- AI may be able to recommend products and services (virtual assistants, etc.)
- Chat bots and robo advisors
* Reduces costs (replaces people)
* AI-powered robo advisors can process natural language and assess customer needs
* Could raise regulatory concerns if robo advisors provide incomplete information


## Optimizing the Operating Model

- Complexity and inefficiency increases operational costs
- Possible solutions:
- Outsourcing can help insurers who lack economies of scale
- Transferring operations to lower cost offshore captives or reinsurers

# LPM-157: Diversification of Longevity and Mortality Risk 

Source Author: Stuart Silverman and Dan Theodore (March 2016)

## Overview of This Reading

This paper highlights the value of using a stochastic mortality model to assess the degree to which mortality risk on a term life product offsets with the longevity risk of a life annuity product

There are a number of tables that appear in the study note, and I recommend reviewing those as you work through the detailed study manual. The video lesson offers some additional perspectives using charts and graphs that pull together key points from various tables in the reading. I think those additional perspectives will be critical in helping you retain the testable points for this paper-which are fairly straightforward if you just line up the numbers in a more simplified fashion! :)

## Key topics for the exam include:

- Understand the basic theory that changes in mortality should have opposite effects on term life insurance and life annuities
- Sources of mortality volatility
- How to quantify the cost of mortality volatility
- How to assess the appropriateness of deterministic margins using stochastic analysis
- How changes in business mix impact the results


## Correlation of Mortality Improvement

Most actuaries believe there is a natural hedge between life insurance mortality risk and payout annuity longevity risk

- For example, higher-than-expected mortality will hurt term life products but help payout annuities


## The question is: to what does the risk offset?

The authors found that appears to be some correlation in the mortality improvement between a typical term life insured and a typical payout annuitant

- The authors looked at historical mortality improvement at age 35 vs. age 75 for both males and females
- Age $35=$ typical term insured age and age $75=$ typical payout annuitant age
- Using annual data:
- Correlation of male term and payout mortality improvement $\approx 2 \%$
- Correlation of female term and payout mortality improvement $\approx 25 \%$
- Using 5-year average to reduce noise:
- Correlation of male term and payout mortality improvement $\approx 26 \%$

## Page 109
- Correlation of female term and payout mortality improvement $\approx 60 \%$
- Key takeaway: there appears to be some correlation (hence opportunity for a hedge), but it's not $100 \%$


# Case Study 

## Hypothetical Products Analyzed

1. Level premium term life insurance

- \$1 billion face with $\$ 3.3 \mathrm{M}$ first year premium
- 10-, 20-, and 30-year level terms considered
- Split male (75\%) / female (25\%)

2. Single premium immediate annuity (SPIA)

- Life only
- Males ages 65, 75, and 85
- $\$ 5.4$ single premium
- $\$ 0.5 \mathrm{M}$ annualized payments

The products were each designed to produce an IRR of $9 \%$ based on distributable earnings Factors affecting profits other than mortality were ignored (differences lapse risk, differing durations, etc.)

The SPIA in-force was smaller than the term in-force (common for typical insurers)

- Most life insurers have more mortality risk than longevity risk


## Are Deterministic Margins Appropriate in Aggregate?

Many insurers apply assumption margins as a scalar to a best estimate
For example:

- Term: increase mortality by $5 \%$ and decrease improvement by $0.50 \%$
- SPIA: decrease mortality by $5 \%$ and increase improvement by $0.50 \%$

Problem: if these assumptions are used simultaneously, it will overstate aggregate risk (doesn't reflect diversification)

- In other words, it's not likely that term mortality would be $5 \%$ higher at the same time SPIA mortality is $5 \%$ lower

The authors found that the term IRR falls from $9.00 \%$ to $6.89 \%$, and the SPIA IRR falls from $9.00 \%$ to $5.36 \%$ when using fixed margins

## Page 110
- The combined IRR was $6.89 \%$ with fixed margins


# Impact of Mortality Volatility 

To reflect mortality volatility, the authors developed a stochastic mortality model based on 3 aspects of mortality risk:

1. Trend risk - uncertainty in future mortality improvement

- Mortality improvement does not follow smooth/predictable trends
- Affected by both long-term waves and random annual fluctuations
- 3 factors affecting trend risk:

1.) Long-term trends (10-years)

- Driven by changes in medical practice/research, society, economy, politics, and the environment

2.) Annual volatility

- Drivers: Extreme weather, disease, and variations in reporting

3.) Correlation between long-term and annual trend volatility
4. Basis risk - uncertainty in the assumed mortality level

- Reflects the risk that a given insurers' mortality experience isn't $100 \%$ of industry experience ${ }^{44}$
- Was modeled independently for the term and SPIA products since sales/underwriting approaches are likely different for those products
- Basis risk is lower for insurers with higher certainty in their best estimate assumption

3. Long-term underwriting risk - uncertainty in how long it takes for underwriting effects to wear off (i.e. transition from select to ultimate mortality)

- Modeled by looking at 3 independent variables:
(a) Uncertainty around initial select period length
(b) Length of grading off period for preferred or substandard mortality
(c) Ultimate mortality level after underwriting has completely worn off

The authors note 2 other sources of mortality volatility that they did not consider:

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{44}$ Unfortunately the term "basis risk" gets used very loosely from reading to reading, and you will likely see it refer to other risks on the syllabus that have nothing to do with mortality risk. What the authors call "basis risk" in this paper is essentially the risk that the best estimate mortality assumption is wrong. In practice, each insurer will likely apply a different ratio of industry experience, but each insurer will have different levels of certainty based on their own experience. Since the authors are doing their study from an industry perspective, they are using a multiple of $100 \%$, but allowing for deviations around that. On other ILA syllabi or in other literature, you may have seen this risk referred to as "volatility around the best estimate" or "level risk."

## Page 111
1. Extreme long-term events (e.g. medical breakthroughs or drug-resistant bacteria that have long-term effects on mortality)
2. Catastrophic short-term events (pandemics, terrorism, etc.)

# Cost of Volatility 

The IRR falls from $9.00 \%$ to $8.72 \%$ for SPIA and $8.86 \%$ for term if mortality is modeled stochastically

- Reason: "asymmetric dispersion" in the tails (i.e. the bad tail is worse than the good tail)
- For payout annuitants, there is a limit on premature death, but annuitants could survive a very long time
- For term insureds, the cost of premature death is greater than premium and investment income gains from surviving

Insurers who do not model mortality stochastically will underprice the products (i.e. not be compensated for the cost of volatility)

## Stochastic Projections of Mortality and Longevity

The authors performed a stochastic simulation involving 1000 scenarios and calculated the PV of distributable earnings and IRRs at various percentiles for both the term and SPIA products

The distribution of results is helpful for understanding how conservative the deterministic fixed margins are in each product

- The $6.95 \%$ term deterministic IRR with fixed margins falls between the 95th and 99th percentile result
- The 5.36\% SPIA deterministic IRR with fixed margins falls between the 90th and 95th percentile result


## Savings From Diversification

Diversification Savings $=$ Combined PVDE - (Standalone Term PVDE + Standalone SPIA PVDE)

The authors found that the savings from diversification increases as you approach the tail

- At the 50th percentile, the savings $\approx 0$
- At the 75 th percentile at nigher, the savings are positive at all discount rates
- At the 99th (worst) percentile, the savings are substantial
- Using an $8 \%$ discount rate, the combined PVDE is 102 K higher (about $11 \%$ higher than the sum of the standalone PVDEs)

The combined IRR is also higher than either of the standalone IRRs at higher percentiles

## Page 112
- The combined IRR tracks pretty closely to the term life IRR at most percentiles ${ }^{45}$
- However, at the 99th percentile, the combined IRR is $6.33 \%$ compared to $-1.59 \%$ and $6.26 \%$ for SPIA and term, respectively


# Fixed Margin vs. Stochastic Modeling 

The $6.89 \%$ IRR based on the combined deterministic results with fixed margins falls between the 95th and 99th percentile of the combined stochastic results

- This suggests that the combined deterministic results with fixed margins are overly conservative if the insurer's risk appetite is at a lower percentile ${ }^{46}$

Stochastic analysis would allow an insurer to revise its deterministic margins so that the resulting IRR better aligns with the insurer's risk appetite based on the stochastic results

- In other words, lower the margins to increase the combined IRR to the level desired (and also increase the combined PVDE)
- The authors solved for new fixed margins that increased the deterministic IRR to $7.55 \%$, which corresponds to the 90th percentile of the stochastic results

If the insurer is able to lower margins to reflect mortality/longevity diversification, the insurer can offer more competitive products

## Managing Business Mix Reflecting Desired Risk Tolerance

In this section, the authors look at different mixes of term and SPIA business
An insurer might be interested to know how much of each product it should target for the mortality/longevity hedge

- Requires stochastic analysis because the deterministic results can't show how the diversification benefit changes as the business mix changes
- Deterministic analysis will show more aggregate cost as the proportion of SPIAs increases (because SPIAs are less profitable than term on a standalone basis)

Overall return $=$ weighted average of term and SPIA returns
The authors found that there is very little difference in IRRs at all percentiles if the SPIA volume is increased $5 x$

However, if SPIAs are increased 10x, IRRs fall at all percentiles
Key takeaway: an insurer can increase its SPIA in-force up to a threshold (5x) before IRRs deteriorate and margins have to be recalibrated ${ }^{47}$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{45}$ This is probably because there is much more term being modeled than SPIA
    ${ }^{46}$ This is may seem confusing without looking at the tables closely, but the authors are just reinforcing the point that the combined deterministic results don't properly reflect diversification because the combined IRR should fall relative to the position of the standalone IRRs.
    ${ }^{47}$ There seems to be a typo on p. 11 where the authors state that " $\ldots$. the fixed margin that was solved

## Page 113
# Impact of Business Mix on Diversification Savings 

I was surprised that the authors do not talk at all about how the diversification savings changes as the business mix changes. Given that they originally set out to determine the extent of the mortality/longevity hedge, this seems worth exploring, so I wanted to add a little more detail here. We can draw some interesting conclusions by comparing numbers across several tables.

For example, at the 99th percentile (where the savings are the most pronounced), we can see that the PVDE savings increase as the SPIA proportion increases:

|  | Combined | SPIA | Term | Savings | Savings \% |
| :-- | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| Baseline | $-826,082$ | $-111,106$ | $-817,206$ | 102,230 | $11 \%$ |
| 5x SPIA | $-945,061$ | $-555,530$ | $-817,206$ | 427,675 | $31 \%$ |
| 10x SPIA | $-1,204,147$ | $-1,111,060$ | $-817,206$ | 724,119 | $38 \%$ |

All of the results above are based on the $8 \%$ discount rate. The baseline result is the same result mentioned in the "Savings From Diversification" section and can also be found in Figure 22. The combined results come from Figures 23 and 24.

The authors do not show the $5 x$ and $10 x$ standalone SPIA results at the 99th percentile, but we can easily calculate those by simply scaling the baseline results by a factor of 5 and 10, respectively. 48 The term volume was held constant, so it is the same in each case.

Key takeaway: As more SPIAs are sold relative to term business, the diversification savings increases. At the 10x level, combined results are $38 \%$ higher than the sum of the standalone results. I'm sure there is some threshold where the savings begins decline, but we don't have enough information to solve for that point. At any rate, being able to reduce tail risk by $38 \%$ seems like a very substantial benefit.

See the video lesson for more numerical perspectives on the authors' results that tie this result in with the IRR results discussed previously.

[^0]
[^0]:    for to approximate the effect of the 90th percentile scenario under the original mix of life insurance and annuity business produces a result that is now between the 90th and 95th percentiles... " They're referring to the $7.55 \%$ IRR mentioned in the previous section. This IRR actually falls between the 75th and 90th percentiles under the 10x SPIA results. This suggests the insurer would need to increase deterministic margins to stay at the 90th percentile if the SPIA proportion is increased.
    ${ }^{48}$ You can verify this in Figure 20, which shows the best estimate deterministic results at the 5x and 10x levels. The $5 x$ and $10 x$ SPIA results are just multiples of the $1 x$ run.

# LPM-173: NAIC Accelerated Underwriting Report 

Source Author: NAIC (April 2022)

## Overview of This Reading

This report is based on research done by the NAIC to understand the current state of accelerated underwriting (AU)

Key conclusion: AU can provide benefits to both insurers and consumers, provided that it is fair and non-discriminatory

## Key topics for the exam include:

- Terminology related to AU: ML, AI, etc.
- How/why insurers currently use AU
- General recommendations for insurers and other parties
- Traditional vs. non-traditional data: types and considerations for using
- FCRA consumer rights and data considerations
- Existing state insurance department regulation
- Focus and purpose of the NAIC's Privacy Protections Working Group


## Overview of Accelerated Underwriting

Life insurance underwriting - process of determining eligibility for insurance and classifying applicants into risk categories, which determine premiums

Traditional life insurance underwriting - assessing the applicant's physical health and other financial/behavioral elements

Accelerated underwriting (AU) - use of big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) to expedite underwriting ${ }^{49}$

- Use of predictive models and ML algorithms (subset of AI)
- Models assign insureds to risk categories
- ML algorithms - a process or set of rules executed to solve an equation ${ }^{50}$
- Can be supervised (directed to analyze patterns) or unsupervised (self-automated)

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{49}$ The paper states that predictive/ML models are "both subcategories of artificial intelligence, which should not be confused with a static rule-based algorithm." And then in a footnote, the paper defines both AI and ML collectively as "an automated process in which a system begins recognizing patterns without being specifically programmed to achieve a pre-determined result." The paper does not provide a separate definition for only AI.
    ${ }^{50}$ We're providing the same definition the paper uses for "ML algorithms" even though it doesn't seem fully consistent with other statements in the paper that say ML is not rule-based and is not specifically programmed to achieve a pre-determined result.

## Page 116
- Data used: non-traditional/non-medical data provided by the applicant or external sources
- Can replace all/ part of traditional underwriting
- AU avoids medical requirements (paramedical exams, fluid collection)


# Life insurers use AU in two primary ways: 

1. Triage applicants: route unsuccessful applicants to TU; successful applicants continue the AU process
2. Rate applicants based on risk categories

Most predictive/ML algorithms are in their 2nd or 3rd generation

- COVID-19 accelerated AU adoption because of the desire for less in-person contact

Benefits of AU reported by insurers (compared to TU):

- Less cumbersome
- Cheaper
- Faster
- Requires less consumer involvement
- Improves the underwriting experience for consumers
- Shortens issue times
- Increases policy acceptance rates


## General Recommendations

## General Issues and Recommendations

- Regulators must ensure the use of AU is fair, transparent, and secure
- Models may result in unfair discrimination even if the data are not overtly discriminatory
- Conclusions should be tested up front and on the back end
- Testing should ensure ML algorithms are accurate across demographic categories
- Scrutiny is especially important for behavioral data
- Gym membership, profession, marital status, family size, grocery shopping habits, wearable technology, and credit attributes
- Even though behavioral data may have a scientific linkage to risk, it can lead to questionable conclusions


## Recommendations for Insurers and Other Parties

## Page 117
- Use data that are transparent, accurate, reliable, and unbiased
- External data sources, algorithms, or models:
- Should be based on sound actuarial principles
- Should have a valid explanation for any correlation/causal connections
- Ensure that the models/algorithms achieve an intended outcome
- Ensure that the outcome of models/algorithms is not unfairly discriminatory
- Provide reasons supporting any adverse underwriting decisions to the consumer
- Protect consumer privacy and ensure security of consumer data
- Have mechanism to correct mistakes if found
- Produce information upon request for regular filing submissions reviews or market conduct examinations


# Data Considerations 

## Traditional Data

- Examples of data used in traditional life insurance underwriting:
- Application data - medical records, prescription questions, vocation questions, financial profile
- Tele-interview
- Medical records
- MIB data (formerly known as Medical Information Bureau)
- Motor vehicle records
- Prescription drug history
- Public records - criminal records, bankruptcy records, civil litigation
- Paramedical/medical exam - e.g. EKGs
- Fluids - e.g. blood, urine, swab/saliva test to determine tobacco usage
- Financial and tax information
- Considerations for use of traditional data
- Has an established history in the industry
* Insurers, consumers, underwriters, and produces are familiar with
- Relationship between traditional data and risk/premiums is well established/understood by consumers

## Page 118
- State laws are based on traditional data with appropriate consumer protections
- Time and costs to obtain/review traditional data are significant


# Non-Traditional Data 

- Examples of non-traditional data used in life insurance underwriting:
- Public records - assessor data, genealogy records, court filings, voter information
- P\&C data from adjacent carriers
- Marketing and social data - shopping habits, mortgage info, occupation, education, social media
- Professional licenses
- Biometric data - voice analysis, facial analysis, etc.
- Wearable devices
- Considerations for the use of non-traditional data
- ASOP 12 considerations:
* Actuary should demonstrate the relationship between a risk characteristic and an expected outcome
* Consumers are less likely to understand the impact of non-traditional data
- Additional rating factors (e.g. via insurance scores) may introduce/amplify disparate impact across demographic groups
- May not have the same consumer protections as FCRA ${ }^{51}$ and traditional data
* No way for consumers to know how data affected their application (or if data were accurate)
* Lack of disclosure requirements
* Privacy concerns


## FCRA Data

Some data are subject to the FCRA, which protects consumer privacy

## - Rights of applicants under the FCRA:

- Insurer must tell the applicant if the information is used to deny insurance or take other adverse action
- Applicants can request the data provided by a consumer reporting agency to an insurer
- Applicants can ask a consumer reporting agency to correct any data errors

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{51}$ Fair Credit Reporting Act.

## Page 119
# Considerations for the use of data subject to FCRA: 

- Readily available and updated regularly
- Already used in life and P\&C lines
- Regulation/oversight already exists - FTC and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
- Not all FCRA data is useful/relevant to life insurance underwriting
- Consumers must formally dispute data they believe is inaccurate
- Extensive and potentially too detailed with non-usable credit attributes
- Adding additional rating factors may introduce/amplify unfair discrimination


## Existing Authority of State Departments of Insurance (DOIs)

If a consumer complains about an insurer's underwriting practices, it also creates an opportunity for DOIs to review an insurer's use of AU

## Possible Actions That Examiners May take

- Review underwriting practices during an examination or when policy rates are submitted
- Request that insurers adequately inform consumers when negative actions are taken
- Request information about source data


## Possible Actions That Form and Rate Reviewers May Take

- Request information about any predictive/ML algorithms used
- Required filing of models used
- Questioning the extent of correlations between data elements and applicant risk
- Request information about source data

Insurers and third party vendors should conduct post-issue audits and make the results available to regulators on request

## NAIC Privacy Protections Working Group

The NAIC's Privacy Protections WG is concerned with protecting consumer data privacy

- Reviews existing protections related to collection/use of insurance transaction data
- Recommends any needed changes to state/federal law

Primary focus: 6 consumer data privacy rights/protections from the NAIC's "Consumer Data Privacy Protections" policy statement:

## Page 120
1. Right to opt-out of data sharing
2. Right to opt-in of data sharing
3. Right to correct information
4. Right to delete information
5. Right to data portability
6. Right to restrict the use of data

Secondary focus: disclosure and and requirements related to...

- Information collected
- Shared information
- Sources of information
- Business purposes for information collected
- Third party involvement

# Market Trends... in a Rising Interest Rate Environment 

Source Author: Yiru Sun, et al., Product Matters! (November 2021)

## Overview of This Reading

This brief article was written in 2021, just when interest rates were starting to rise for the first time in a while

The authors discuss product trends leading up to 2021 and speculate about how the current interest rate cycle might play out based on past cycles

This article was already two years old when it was added to the syllabus in 2023, and interest rates have increased much more since then. For exam purposes, I recommend treating this article as "current," however.

## Key topics for the exam include:

- Product trends that resulted from persistent low interest rates
- Lessons learned from previous interest rate cycles


## Trends Resulting from Persistent Low Interest Rates

The following trends emerged in the years leading up to 2021

## - Life Insurance

- Premium rates increased, especially for term
- Term and WL sales remained steady
- Multiple companies plan to exit the life insurance completely (or already have)
- Major ULSG carriers have paused ULSG sales
- Active management of NGEs (e.g. raised COI charges) even if it means litigation
- Insurers want to increase retention of profitable post-level term business


## - Annuities

- More focus on accumulation; less on long-tailed secondary guarantees
- RILA market has expanded
- VA market share has decreased; some insurers have exited
- More GA product competition from PE-backed companies
- Increased use of reinsurance for fixed annuities, including FIAs
* Redundant reserve financing treaties utilized to aid profitability
* Offshore reinsurance transactions utilized to for ALM and access to a broader range of investment options (e.g. alternatives and long dated assets)

## Page 122
- Fixed annuity sales increase when credit spreads widen
- Active management of NGEs (crediting rates)


# - Long-Term Care Insurance 

- Carriers continue to exit the standalone LTC market
- New standalone LTC products have simpler designs, less rich benefits, or cost-sharing features (e.g. co-pays)
- Some mutual companies have introduced par LTC policies that shift risk to policyholders
- Increase in LTC combo products and new chassis that mitigate interest rate risk (VUL) ${ }^{52}$
- Continued investment in inforce management, including premium rate increases


## Past Periods of Rising Rates

There have been 3 periods of rising 10-year Treasury rates in the last 20 years:

1. $2003-2006$
2. $2012-2013$
3. $2016-2018$

The 3 periods have 2 things in common:

1. The 10-year rate only increased $1 \%$ to $1.5 \%$ over a 2-year period
2. Rates fell sharply after each period

Assuming the trends are repeated with the current rise in interest rates:

1. Portfolio rates won't change significantly, so it won't improve insurers' profits
2. The increase in rates may be short-term

## Lessons Learned From Previous Periods of Rising Interest Rates

1. Focus on product designs that perform well in rising interest rate environments

- WL is the most stable when interest rates change dramatically
- Simple, compatible product design
- Use of portfolio pricing instead of new money
- Interest-sensitive products are hurt when interest rates are low

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{52}$ An LTCI combo product is a life or annuity product with an integrated LTCI rider. If the insured meets the criteria for LTC benefits, the benefits are paid out of the DB on the base life policy or the annuity AV. The base product is called the "chassis," a word borrowed from the concept of a car's base frame.

## Page 123
- ULSG becomes expensive for policyholders
- Fixed annuities become unattractive compared to indexed or variable products
- Sales rise when rates rise again
- FIA and IUL also perform well when interest rates rise if equity markets are also rising
- Flexible product designs that promote sales and mitigate interest rate risk:
- 1-year rate guarantee instead of multi-year
* Pro to insurer: can make timely adjustments based on market
* Pro to policyholder: potentially higher guarantees that adapt to markets
- Multi-year rate guarantees with small stair-step rate increases
* Pro to insurer: less risk since steps are small (e.g. 15 bps)
* Pro to policyholder: mitigates risk of low/flat guarantee
- Participation in equity markets/indexes
* Pro to insurer: higher illustrated returns with lower guarantees
* Pro to policyholder: earn returns comparable to other financial products
- Monthly cap instead of annual cap
* Pro to insurer: increased product popularity with low risk of large loss
* Pro to policyholder: possibility of much higher annual return
- Cumulative guarantees over a defined period (e.g. 2\%/year for 5 years)
* Pro to insurer: cheaper than annual guarantee
* Pro to policyholder: same guaranteed increase over a longer term
- Participation by paying dividends during favorable market conditions
* Pro to insurer: weaker guarantee, so less risk in unfavorable markets
* Pro to policyholder: can participate in insurer's performance
- Stacking rollup for FIA GLWBs ${ }^{53}$
* Pro to insurer: decreases strain and adds flexibility
* Pro to policyholder: potential upside if market performs well

2. Be mindful of new money rate implications on portfolio returns
[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{53}$ The article does not define what this means, but it was a trick that carriers came up with in the 2010s to reduce GLWB risk by making the GLWB rollup partly a function of returns on the indexed account. Insurers guaranteed a smaller rollup rate that was "stacked" on top of the return earned by the index. This was less risky than using a larger constant rollup rate independent of market performance.

## Page 124
- If the rise in interest rates is short-term, portfolio rates will continue to fall (hurting profits)
- Recommendations for insurers:
- Be prudent in providing higher credited rates and/or longer guarantees
- Reduce nonguaranteed benefits and costs (e.g. sales rep compensation)
- Closely monitor features (e.g. ROP riders) where low interest rates with level premiums will erode profits

3. Pay close attention to long-term impact and tail-risk scenarios

- In the early 1980s, UL writers shortened their asset portfolios to take advantage of very high short rates relative to long rates
- When short rates eventually fell, UL writers moved to risky assets to maintain returns
- This worked well until junk bond market collapsed in the early 1990s
- 3 large insurers went insolvent with mass UL surrenders
- "This example serves as a reminder to consider the financial impact of tail-risk scenarios"

# Life Insurance for the Digital Age 

Source Author: Nitin Nayak and Stephen Abrokwah, Product Matters (November 2017)

## Overview of This Reading

This article describes how "end-to-end underwriting" can be used to help insurers sell more life insurance, especially to individuals with low-to-medium mortality risk in the middle-income and millennial market

## Key topics for the exam include:

- Sales trends driving the need for improved underwriting
- Traditional underwriting methods
- Ways of improving customer satisfaction
- The end-to-end process: know each step and be able to describe


## Introduction

## Key Life Insurance Sales Trends

- Sales have been declining and are at a 50-year low
- Sharpest decline: middle-income and millennial market
- Average US household is under-insured by 400 K
- Sales have shifted to higher net worth individuals
- Average face amount has risen
- Most agents focus on the higher net worth market
- Distribution channels are not designed to serve the mid-market, who has been left to educate themselves


## End-to-End Underwriting vs. Traditional Underwriting

End-to-end underwriting involves the use of predictive analytics, underwriting automation, and business intelligence to make underwriting less time-consuming, costly, and invasive for applicants

- Result: higher sales/profits and a better customer experience

Traditionally, full underwriting results in the lowest mortality cost, but it is the most timeconsuming and expensive

- Full underwriting (lowest mortality cost)
- Medical/para-medical exam
- Collection of fluids (blood/urine)

## Page 126
- Analysis of records (Rx, MVR, and MIB) ${ }^{54}$
- Non-medical underwriting (higher mortality cost)
- No medical/para-medical exam
- No fluid collection
- Analysis of records (Rx, MVR, and MIB)

Supplementing non-medical underwriting with predictive analytics can bring mortality costs closer to fully underwritten

# Improving Customer Satisfaction 

A survey found that insurance customer satisfaction lags far behind personal banking and other online retail experiences

Life insurers may be able to increase customer satisfaction with millennials and the midmarket by providing the following:

- Quick tutorial on life insurance products with a concise explanation of benefits
- Individualize needs analysis and recommendations based on life situation
- Simpler application process - fewer questions and pre-filled user-specific information
- Real time quotes similar to online auto insurance quotes
- Relevant quote alternatives with coverages and premiums for comparison
- View of life insurance and related products (e.g. purchased by peers)


## The End-to-End Process (9 Steps)

The remainder of the article consists of 9 steps that make up the authors' recommended end-to-end process. They also refer to these 9 steps as "innovations for accelerated underwriting in life insurance."

Step 1: Improve User Interaction (Application Process)
Step 2: Fluid-Less Risk Score Prediction
Step 3: Smoker Propensity Predictions Using Predictive Analytics
Step 4: Triage Applications that Require Traditional Underwriting (Send to Step 9)
Step 5: Risk Classification Using Risk Score Thresholds
Step 6: External Rules Engine
Step 7: Mortality-Risk-Based Pricing Algorithms for Quote Generation

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{54}$ These are common abbreviations for medical prescription records (Rx), motor vehicle records (MVR), and Medical Information Bureau (MIB) data.

## Page 127
Step 8: Real-Time Customer Response
Step 9: Traditional Underwriting of Selected Applicants From Step 4

# Step 1: Improve User Interaction (Application Process) 

Goal: Improve application process on mobile, which millennials and the mid-market are quite fond of

Solutions for reducing the number of questions on applications

- Machine learning can identify questions with the highest predictive power (discard others)
- Pre-fill information using internal/external data sources
- Use behavioral economics to improve veracity (truthfulness) of responses


## Step 2: Fluid-Less Risk Score Prediction

Goal: Reduce dropout rates and improve customer satisfaction using non-traditional data and predictive analytics to assess risk

Predictive models may be able to use the following data sources (avoiding the need for medical exams and fluid collection)

- Third party data (Rx, MVR, and MIB)
- Use: assess medical history, propensity to take risk, etc.
- Public data (properties, professional licenses, criminal history)
- Use: validation and filling in missing info
- Financial (income/employment, debt) and credit history/score
- Use: predict mortality risk for low-risk individuals
- Digital imaging (facial image analysis)
- Use: assess age, BMI, and smoking status
- Social data (Facebook, etc.)
- Use: verify identity, hobbies, smoking/alcohol/drug use
- Population-level open data (census and CDC data)
- Use: fill in missing data and determine smoker propensity at a coarse level
- Other medical records and health/wellness data (heart rate and physical activity from wearables; food preferences, psychological health)
- Use: assess mortality risk and health factors


## Step 3: Smoker Propensity Predictions Using Predictive Analytics

Goal: Use predictive analytics to predict smoker status instead of using blood samples to detect cotinine

## Page 128
- Models have been shown to predict smoker status with high accuracy
- Precision is based on how many predicted true-positives are actually true-positives
- A good model should not misclassify many smokers as non-smokers (since that type of error is the most costly)


# Step 4: Triage Applications that Require Traditional Underwriting 

Goal: Identify higher risk applicants that require traditional underwriting using a ruledriven triage process

- Could have multiple predictive analytics models along a decision tree


## Step 5: Risk Classification Using Risk Score Thresholds

Goal: Use predictive analytics to predict underwriting class (instead of a human)
2 approaches to predicting mortality risk using a risk score:

1. Use the score to predict the risk class

- Preferred by underwriters

2. Use the score to predict expected mortality, then convert to an appropriate risk class

- More objective than \#1

A/E ratios can be used to validate predicted risk classes against historical human underwriterderived risk classes

- Lower A/E ratios = better underwriting decisions


## Step 6: External Rules Engine

Goal: Complement predictive models with proprietary and industry-sponsored research studies

- Traditionally, rules engines have assigned risk classes from a table based on total risk loadings from various factors:
- Family history of significant illnesses, participation in hazardous activities, etc.
- External rules engines can be used to refine risk class assignment


## Step 7: Mortality-Risk-Based Pricing Algorithms for Quote Generation

## Goal: Show the customer more options and choices

- Compute prices for various combinations of face amounts and term periods
- Show historical choices made by other users, who are similar to the applicant


## Step 8: Real-Time Customer Response

Goal: Offer assistance to the customer to make a buying decision

## Page 129
- Show alternative coverages in case the original request is not affordable for the customer
- Provide alternative life insurance product in case the customer does not qualify for the original request
- Illustrate how each policy covers various adverse life events
- Provide an overview of products purchased by "people like me"


# Step 9: Traditional Underwriting of Selected Applicants From Step 4 

Goal: Use traditional underwriting for risks that need more investigation based on the triage process in Step 4

## Overview of This Reading

This paper presents the results of various consumer surveys on life insurance and makes recommendations to insurers

While this paper has more of a general product development and marketing emphasis, some of the key concepts here will appear in other readings-e.g. you will see the cognitive biases appear again later in the course in the context of policyholder behavior

## Key topics for the exam include:

- General reasons why people buy life insurance
- How life insurance evolve along the life cycle
- Personality traits that influence purchase decisions
- Socioeconomic indicators that increase purchase probability
- Possible explanations why consumers don't buy life insurance
- General consumer attitudes toward life insurance
- Why buying life insurance is a complex, demanding process
- Failures of traditional economics
- Postulates of prospect theory (behavioral economics)
- Applying cognitive biases to life insurance
- Where consumers seek information
- Where consumers buy life insurance
- What consumers actually want from life insurance
- Understanding willingness to pay (WTP)
- How insurers can respond


## Executive Summary

This paper offers advice to life insurers to help them adapt to changing consumer decisionmaking dynamics

Key challenges addressed:

1. Many people do not buy life insurance even though it would be rational to do so

- Common themes as to why consumers don't buy life insurance:
- Price, affordability, and value for money
- Perceived lack of need
- Limited product knowledge

## Page 131
- Product complexity
- Lack of trust in the insurance industry
- Behavioral economics may shed light on consumer decisions with respect to life insurance

2. Consumers want to be empowered in their purchase decision-they do not want to be "sold to"

# Life Insurance Valuable but Often Insufficient 

Life insurance protects consumers against a wide range of unfavorable events, which are difficult to predict

An individual's life insurance needs evolve over their lifecycle-from income protection at the youngest working ages to wealth accumulation at older working ages to wealth payout and transfer in retirement

| Product | Youth | Working Years | Retirement |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Medical insurance | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ |
| Term life insurance |  | $\checkmark$ |  |
| Disability |  | $\checkmark$ |  |
| Deferred annuties |  | $\checkmark$ |  |
| Whole life |  | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ |
| CI and LTCI |  | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ |
| Payout annuities |  |  | $\checkmark$ |

Milestone events - events that trigger a decision to purchase insurance

- Birth of a child
- New job
- Home purchase


## Other factors that influence insurance purchases:

- Recommendations from financial advisors or marketing materials
- Advice from family and friends
- Work-related experiences (e.g. loss of group life coverage)
- Negative life events that trigger thoughts of mortality: (e.g. death of a family member, major accidents, $9 / 11$ )

Probability of buying life insurance increases with the following personality traits:

1. Risk averse people tend to be more likely to buy life insurance

- Risk averse people tend not to drink, smoke, jump out of planes, etc.

## Page 132
- People who take preventative measures to reduce risk (e.g. wear seatbelt)

2. Sense of accountability - if a person has other people that depend on them (e.g. children), they are more likely to buy life and disability insurance

Governments and employers are increasingly shifting responsibility for these risks to individuals Despite the need to buy life insurance, many people are not doing it

- Swiss Re estimates the global gap in mortality coverage at $\$ 86$ trillion
- The largest gap is in Asia ( $\$ 32$ trillion) followed by the USA ( $\$ 20$ trillion)


# Sidebar: Socio Economic Indicators and the Likelihood of Having Life Insurance 

Swiss Re sponsored a survey to identify factors that explain the likelihood that someone will purchase life insurance

Factors that increase the probability of buying life insurance:

- Higher income (> EUR 80K) and socioeconomic class (both are highly significant)
- Higher trust in financial institutions (compared to friends/family or no one at all)
- Males more likely to buy than females
- Older age (probability increases with age up to 59)
- Married
- Have kids
- Have mortgage

Highest probability (79\%): a married, 50-something upper middle class man with kids, a mortgage, and high income who relies on the financial industry for advice

Lowest probability (14\%): Single 20-something working class female student with no kids, no mortgage and doesn't know who to trust for insurance advice

## Why Do Consumers NOT Buy Life Insurance?

## Possible Explanations Why Consumers Don't Buy Life Insurance

## 1. Rational demand limitations

- Social security and government programs may crowd out demand for private insurance
- Life insurance may not be high enough in consumers' hierarchy needs when disposable income is low
- Complicated, lengthy application/underwriting processes create "transaction costs" that exceed what consumers are willing to pay

## Page 133
# 2. Psychological and behavioural biases 

- Includes time-inconsistent preferences, lack of financial literacy, overconfidence, information/choice overload
- Perceived lack of priority due to weaknesses in financial literacy or tendency to procrastinate
- More on these later in the reading


## 3. Market failures

- Can result from asymmetric information and adverse selection problems
- To mitigate adverse selection, insurers may need to charge higher prices to reflect higher risks
- Difficult to increase premiums for term because it is so competitive, but may be easier for a product like LTC

Consumer surveys can be useful, but there are potential problems:

1. Actual behavior may be different from what consumers indicate in surveys
2. The way survey questions are framed influences answers

## Regional Attitudes Toward Life Insurance

- US, Europe and Latin America

1. Too expensive/cannot afford it (top reasons)
2. Procrastination/not finished shopping
3. Do not need it
4. Knowledge issue
5. Lack of trust/resentment

- Asia-Pacific

1. Affordabilty and value for money (top reasons)
2. Price
3. Level of coverage
4. General economic uncertainty
5. Low return
6. Have other investment priorities
7. Don't need it
8. Reputation of insurers

## Page 134
9. Investment risks associated with insurance
10. My employer pays for it

People in developed Asia-Pacific areas were actually more likely to cite "no spare money" as a reason than people in emerging areas

# Key Survey Findings 

In all regions, people have a poor understanding of life insurance

- Less than $50 \%$ of consumers feel like they had all the information needed to make financial decisions
- Most households do not know how much life insurance they need
- Tend to buy small amounts relative to their risk exposure

Insurers continue using archaic, confusing contract terminology

- Results in the wrong word associations
- Young consumers are more likely to associate:
- "Agent" with the FBI
- "Protection" with birth control
- "Policy" with general rules

Underwriting complexity can deter consumers, especially those with a strong sense of responsibility

- Medical actions can seem invasive (drawing blood, etc.)

Value for money is a common theme resulting from 2 key problems

1. Consumers commonly do not understand the benefits of life insurance
2. Consumers are put off by the convoluted buying process

## Solutions for insurers:

1. Must demonstrate the benefits of insurance products to consumers
2. Must improve the perceptions of non-buyers of life insurance, who far outnumber buyers according to one survey

- $88 \%$ of households were non-buyers, the vast majority of which didn't even shop for life insurance to begin with
- $78 \%$ of households did not "seriously shop" for life insurance
- $22 \%$ of households did "seriously shop" for life insurance
- Only about half actually ended up buying ( $12 \%$ of all households)

## Page 135
# Consumer Decision Making 

## The Decision-Making Process

1. Problem recognition and needs assessment
2. Information search
3. Evaluation and selection
4. Vender choice and purchase

With straightforward products (e.g. breakfast cereal and TIA online seminars!), people take decision shortcuts (just go from 1 to 4), but this is not possible with life insurance

Buying life insurance is a complex, demanding process that requires all 4 steps above

- The needs assessment step requires unpleasant thinking ("what if I die?")
- Requires navigating lengthy product descriptions
- Underwriting is time consuming, non-transparent

Traditional economics has turned out to be a poor predictor of consumer decision making

- Traditional economics assumes people are "rational agents" (make rational decisions that maximize utility)
- People should choose investments with that maximize probability-weighted utility
- Example: $50 \%$ chance of winning 500 is better than a $10 \%$ chance of winning 1000
- People are assumed to be risk averse
- Will choose more certain outcomes even if the expected payout is less
- Leads to the assumption that people should want to buy insurance
- In reality, people usually don't maximize their long-term utility and they systematically make irrational decisions
- Has given rise to behavioral economics, which says emotions, sense of fairness, and cognitive biases play an important role in decision making


## Prospect Theory and Cognitive Biases

2 pillars of behavioral economics: prospect theory and cognitive biases

1. Prospect theory seeks to explain consumer decisions when outcomes and information are uncertain
2. People have certain cognitive biases that result in what appears to be irrational decision making

## Page 136
# Main Postulates of Prospect Theory 

Prospect theory says that people's attitude toward risk is determined jointly by the following:

## 1. Reference dependence

- People make decisions about gains and losses relative to a reference point (usually the status quo)
- People are short-sighted ("narrow-framed") - focus more on short-term deviations in utility/wealth than long-term


## 2. Loss aversion

- Losses hurt more than gains of the same magnitude
- Evolutionary explanation: not gambling with what you possess increases your chances of survival


## 3. Diminishing sensitivity to gains and losses

- People prefer small, sure gains over large, unlikely gains
- People are more risk averse following a gain (in the "gain domain")
- Concave utility: additional gains provide less and less additional utility
- People are more likely to seek risk following a loss (in the "loss domain")
- Convex utility: Additional gains provide increasing additional utility


## 4. Probability weighting

- People are bad at evaluating tail events
- Tend to overweight low probability events and underweight high probability events

General interpretation of prospect theory: buying insurance is a loss domain decision

- Individuals prefer to be uninsured (assume risk) because they overweight the certain loss of paying premiums and/or underweight the low probability insured event
- Premiums $>$ E[Loss on death]


## Cognitive Biases

This list consolidates the overlapping "key cognitive biases" listed in the main body of the reading with the "select cognitive biases" table on p. 16 of the reading

## 1. Procrastination and status quo bias

- People tend to delay making unpleasant, demanding decisions
- Buying insurance presents many opportunities to procrastinate, especially if medical underwriting is involved
- People tend to like things to stay the same (status quo)

## Page 137
# 2. Time-inconsistent preferences 

- People make short-sighted decisions they later regret
- Hyperbolic discounting - people prefer immediate payoffs over future payoffs
- Tendency is higher the closer the future payoff is to the present
- "Would you prefer a $\$ 1$ today or $\$ 3$ tomorrow?" - many people choose $\$ 1$
- One study found that people MUCH prefer a lump sum payment to a stream of future annuity payments
- The implied discount rate was $20 \%$


## 3. Framing

- Decisions are affected by how information is presented and who presents it
- Annuity purchases are greatly affected by framing
- Default options - going with a default option is often easier than making a decision
- Plays on status quo bias
- If consumers had to opt out of insurance instead of opt in, sales would likely increase


## 4. Overconfidence and risk perception

- People often overestimate their abilities and overestimate favorable outcomes (don't think they need insurance)
- $93 \%$ of drivers think they are better drivers than the median
- Risk of dying at a young age is usually ignored
- Once the probability of an event is below a certain level, it is assumed to be zero

5. Availability bias and salience - Perceived risk increases after certain events occur (becomes salient)

- More likely to buy property insurance after an earthquake or life insurance after a $9 / 11$ event


## 6. Information overload

- When presented with too much information and choices, consumers either fail to act or make poor decisions
- Evidence shows people are less likely to buy a good or service if there are too many options


## 7. Heuristics (mental short cuts) and herding

- People would rather avoid complex decision making and just follow their peers' choices or social norms
- People are more likely to buy life insurance if friends/family do

## Page 138
- Complexity also arises from regulation and technical terminology
- Heuristics - simplified experience-based techniques for decision making (rules of thumb, "common sense," etc.)


# 8. Mental accounting 

- People implicitly allocate money to different "mental accounts"
- More likely to spend money in certain "buckets" than others

9. Narrow framing

- Type of risk aversion caused by only taking short-term consequences into account without considering total wealth

Key insight from behavioral economics: changing the context in which decisions are made and how information is presented has a big impact on consumer actions

Downside to behavioral economics: many aspects are very context-specific and cannot be generalized

## Understanding the Consumer Buying Experience

The material in this section is based on different consumer surveys administered around the world

## Where Consumers Seek Information

Traditionally, consumers have relied on advice from a sales person or advisor, but this is suboptimal for several reasons:

1. Element of mistrust since consumers know advisors are motivated by financial incentives
2. Asymmetric information and principal-agent problem

Increasingly, consumers use the internet and social media

- Makes information cheaper, more accessible
- Allows consumers to review content, share opinions
- People trust online content generated by their peers
- Online comparison sites will become increasingly important


## Regional differences:

- Western Europe / Anglo-Saxon markets are more likely to rely on professional advice
- Asia, Central/Eastern Europe: more likely to use informal networks (e.g. friends and family)


## Age variations:

- Younger consumers are more likely to trust the internet and friends more

- Older consumers are more likely to rely on insurers and advisors
- However there is a shift to the internet here too


# Key conclusions: 

- Overall, the internet and social networks will likely become more important for all age groups and regions
- Transparency and trust in the life insurance industry should increase


## Where Consumers Buy Life Insurance

Most life insurance is still sold face-to-face with agents/brokers, but online channels are catching up

Simpler/transparent products (e.g. term life) are more likely to be bought online

- Savings and variable products are more likely to be sold by an agent/broker

In emerging markets, insurance is bought via internet-enabled mobile phones

## What Consumers Expect from Life Insurance

Consumers' mainly want 3 things:

1. Simpler, more transparent products and purchasing processes
2. Trust - want long-term relationships with insurers

- Customers generally feel that life insurers make very little effort to retain them at the point of policy lapse

3. Loyalty rewards for keeping their contract with a given insurer

## Attitudes toward insurers:

- People usually have a negative view of the individual industry as a whole but are content with their insurer
- Some surveys indicate that consumers don't feel insurers are consumer-centric
- Use confusing language in contracts
- Try to find loopholes to avoid paying claims
- Products are too complicated
- Only want the consumer's money

Select regional differences:

- In the Netherlands, the number 1 thing consumers want is the scrapping of fine print and more transparency
- "Lower premiums" were 6th on the list

## Page 140
- Most important Asia-Pacific factors:
- Developed Asia-Pacific: value for money
- Emerging Asia-Pacific: financial reputation and strength


# Key takeaway: insurers should be more customer-centric 

- Simplify products, increase transparency in sales and underwriting
- Improve communication
- Build long-term relationships and recognize loyalty


## What Consumers are Willing to Pay (WTP) for Insurance

If insurers can better understand WTP, it will be easier to tailor products to customer segments Just because someone does not buy a life insurance policy, it doesn't mean they weren't willing to pay

- It could be that they were put off by the buying experience


## Factors that increase WTP

1. Higher income
2. Older age (WTP increases with age up until retirement age)
3. Higher trust in the financial industry
4. Regional differences

- Emerging markets: income and education have highest impacts; men are WTP more than women
- In developed Asia-Pacific, WTP is higher for women, families, and married people


## Key takeaways for insurers:

- Marketing strategies must be country-specific
- High WTP for some products could be an opportunity to create more segmented products
- Understanding WTP could be a competitive advantage


## How Insurers Can Respond

Life insurance needs to become "bought," not "sold"

- The modern customer wants to research options from unbiased sources and rely on peers

Insurers must become more customer-centric

- Change negative view of insurance industry
- Make buying experience easier

## Page 141
- Establish social norms that encourage life insurance purchase
- Improve knowledge of consumers through data mining and research

Insurers should simplify and innovate product design

- Provide simpler, transparent products
- Easier for consumers to understand
- Easier to automate for online sales
- Tailor products to each stage of the life cycle
- Offer more cash value or return of premium products
- ROP can be appealing even if not economically attractive
- Educate consumers on the social benefits of insurance (pooling risks)


# Insurers should mitigate psychological barriers 

- Use "smart defaults" to increase sales
- Make workplace life insurance opt-out instead of opt-in
- Offer an "Insure Tomorrow" contract where policyholders commit to buying pre-defined amounts of life insurance if certain future life events occur (e.g. birth of a child)
- Offer option to revoke a contract if consumer has second thoughts within a specified timeframe
- Mitigates worries about long-term commitment, regrets, etc.

Insurers should streamline the underwriting process

- Use simplified underwriting
- Shorten the process
- Automate underwriting for standard risks

Insurers can use predictive analytics to improve data mining, pricing, underwriting, and marketing

Insurers can improve communication and consumer education

- Use friendlier, more transparent language in contracts
- Provide examples of how insurers have helped customers through difficult times
- Mitigate cognitive biases like overconfidence and risk perception
- Increase financial literacy in schools and the workplace

Insurers can use a multi-channel distribution approach

## Page 142
- A "research online, purchase offline" approach empowers consumers to learn but retains the value of face-to-face advice
- Reduces asymmetric information
- Individual sales staff will be challenged to justify their value added
- Competition and comparison sites will increase

Insurers should improve long-term relationships and reward loyalty

- Reward long-term customers
- Engage consumers more at key lifecycle points
- Streamline the selling process to increase trust and loyalty
- Offer more flexible products to meet consumer needs

Insurers should embrace social media

- Get more "likes"

Insurers should increase consumer research to close the knowledge gap

- Reach more of the non-buyers
- Identify obstacles using behavioral economics
- Use WTP analysis
- Data mine customer databases to identify future consumer needs


# Conclusion 

Many people do not buy life insurance but are aware of its benefits
More attention should be paid to behavioral economics
Life insurers should simplify their products and give consumers more research tools
Life insurers should adapt their distribution strategies

# Response of Life Insurance Pricing to Life Settlements 

Source Author: Daniel Theodore, Product Matters (September 2006)

## Overview of This Reading

This article discusses developments in the secondary market for life insurance policies
This is a market where policyholders sell their policies to investors seeking a return

## Key topics for the exam include:

- The viatical market
- Traditional life settlements - how they work, products involved, and how insurers have reacted so far
- Premium financing - 3 types
- How settlements will affect pricing going forward


## The Viatical Market

Viatical settlement - When an investor buys a life insurance policy and then receives the death benefit when the insured dies

Medical advancements with AIDS made these less profitable (insureds weren't dying as soon as expected)

Viatical business shifted to impaired lives
Insurance companies began offering accelerated death benefits (ADB) in response
Allows policyholder to receive a substantial portion of the death benefit if life expectancy is less than 2 years

## Traditional Life Settlements

Similar to viaticals
Policyholders sell their policies to the highest bidder
Bidders estimate insured's life expectancy
Policyholder receives more than they would through cash surrender
The investor is allowed to hold the asset at fair market value
This market is growing very fast
Problems that have occurred due to increasing bidding activity:

- Policies are being accepted with longer life expectancies
- Bidding up prices too high resulting in overpayment

## Page 144
- Lack of compensation disclosure

Popular products include:

- UL policies hurt by falling interest rates
- WL policies where policyholder can get more than cash value
- Big face policies


# How Insurers Have Responded to Life Settlements 

- Make life hard for settlement providers: Limit number of illustrations provided and response time
- Public announcements portraying settlements as a bad deal for policyholders
- "If you can't beat 'em, join 'em": Some insurers are buying settlements and holding them as assets

Another solution to reduce settlement activity would be to pay policyholders a higher CSV based on updated underwriting

## Premium Financing - 3 Types

1. Insured Borrows Money To Buy Policy

The loan covers the first 2 years' premiums
After 2 years, policyholder can 1) repay loan and keep policy or 2) transfer policy to lender as a life settlement

## 2. Charity-Owned Life Insurance

Investors lend money to purchase a policy on someone who wants to donate death benefit to charity
The charity has an insurable interest in the donor
When donor (the insured) dies, death benefit is split between investors and charity
Point of debate: how much return should investors make?

## 3. Stranger-Owned Life Insurance

Mechanics are the same as charity-owned (just no charity involved)

## Factors That Will Drive Growth in Settlement Market

- Continued strong demand for larger face policies
- In 2 years, many premium-financed policies will be transfered to investors
- Settlement companies may be able to estimate life expectancy more accurately than standard tables used in pricing
- Preferred underwriting may wear off, leading to a higher policy value than cash value

## Page 145
- Investors will likely target low premium products to exploit mispricing


# Impacts of Settlements on Pricing 

- Settlement policies will get minimum funding needed to keep them in force
- Expect high persistency and high mortality, especially at older ages
- Inefficiencies in policyholder behavior may go away
- AXXX reinsurance is getting harder to find

AXXX relates to lapse-supported business (e.g. no-lapse guarantee UL)

- Underwriting may ultimately improve thanks to increased investor interest (economic underwriting)
- High settlement activity can be a sign that the product is mispriced

# What if Mortality Stops Improving? 

Source Author: Craig Reynolds and Aatman Dattani, Product Matters! (August 2023)

## Overview of This Reading

This short article looks at recent trends in mortality improvement rates and proposes a new type of mortality-indexed life insurance that could help insurers mitigate uncertainty in future mortality improvement

We will use the abbreviation "MIR" for "mortality improvement rate" in the course materials. Even though the source reading does not use that abbreviation, it's fairly common in the industry.

## Key topics for the exam include:

- Historical and recent trends in US mortality improvement
- Cases for and against expecting future mortality improvement
- Mortality-indexed life insurance


## Trends in US Mortality Improvement

US life expectancy increased at a diminishing rate from the middle of the 20th century through the first decade of the 21st century

In the 2010s, life expectancy plateaued, then fell at the end of the decade
The authors of the article solved for implied mortality scalars that reproduce historical life expectancies and then converted those into MIRs

- Mortality scalar $=$ factor applied to mortality rates in year $t$ that results in the same life expectancy as mortality rates in year $t+1$
- Year-on-year MIR $=1-$ mortality scalar

For example, if 2011 mortality is $99.34 \%$ of 2010 mortality, there was a $0.66 \%$ mortality improvement rate

## Observations in Historical Mortality Improvement

- Mortality has generally improved each decade since the 1940s (MIRs $>0$ )
- Male and female MIRs were different but followed the same general trend
- MIRs have been volatile, but dampened somewhat in the last 30 years
- Mortality deteriorated (increased) in the 2010s, which had multiple years with negative improvement (MIRs $<0$ )
- COVID-19 drove much of this but not all

## Page 147
- 2019-2020 mortality deterioration for males and females was $18 \%$ and $15.5 \%$, respectively ${ }^{55}$
- Even after removing COVID-19-specific deterioration in 2019-2020, male and female mortality still deteriorated slightly in 2019-2020
- Life expectancy also declined between 2014 and $2017^{56}$

It is difficult to predict future MIRs based on past MIRs because mortality trends are influenced by a variety of uncertain factors

# The Case for Expecting Future Mortality Improvement 

## Drivers of past improvement:

1. Improved medical technology

- New vaccines
- Advancements in treatments/procedures

2. Public health initiatives

- Tobacco control measures
- Improved sanitation
- Better access to clean water and air

3. Improved automobile safety

- Car features: seatbelts, airbags, crumple zones, anti-lock brakes, etc.
- Decrease in speed limits

4. Reduced incidence of driving under the influence of alcohol/drugs

- Mothers Against Drunk Driving

The US has a lower life expectancy than many other countries
The argument in favor of continued mortality improvement assumes previous drivers will be replaced with new ones

- However, these drivers may dampen or even reverse over time


## The Case for Expecting Future Mortality Deterioration

The past is not always indicative of the future ${ }^{57}$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{55}$ The source reading shows these as positive numbers, but refers to them as "deterioration," so our interpretation is that these were negative MIRs: $\sim 18 \%$ and $\sim 15.5 \%$.
    ${ }^{56}$ This is another way of saying mortality deteriorated (increased) or that MIRs were negative.
    ${ }^{57}$ The authors make their point with a fairly bleak Bertrand Russell quote, which explains that a domestic chicken is ultimately killed by the hand that fed it, ". . . showing that more refined views as to the uniformity of nature would have been useful to the chicken."

## Page 148
There are many indications that mortality improvement might dampen in the future, if not reverse as it did in the 2010s

# 1. Climate change 

- The Paris Climate Accords called for limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius
- Even 2 degrees, however, could result in higher mortality over the next several decades
- Economic disruptions, tropical diseases, natural disasters, pollution, resource depletion, and famine
- A larger increase in global temperature would be even worse


## 2. Squaring of the survival curve

- The sudden death of otherwise healthy people was once more common
- Women and infants dying in childbirth
- Dysentery, smallpox, polio, measles
- Omega = age at which the mortality rate is assumed to reach 1.0
- Hasn't really changed: few people have ever lived past 120 at any point in human history
- US life expectancy at birth has effectively doubled in the last 160 years
- Unlikely to happen again no matter how much mortality risk falls
- There may be a natural upper limit on omega, even if we can lower mortality risk at ages less than omega ${ }^{58}$

3. Impact of Long COVID (long-term effects of a previous COVID-19 infection)

- Will likely dampen mortality improvement, even though the effect on mortality is not well understood
- It's also possible mortality will improve more in the future if COVID accelerated the death of people who already had higher mortality risk and co-morbidities


## 4. Population growth and a more mobile population

- Dramatically increases the risk that previously rare/nonexistent diseases will jump from animals to humans
- Examples: AIDS , bird flu, Ebola, COVID
- Future pandemics may be worse than COVID, especially if vaccines are too limited, ineffective, or too late


## 5. Alcohol and drug abuse

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{58}$ This is what the authors mean by "squaring of the curve." The argument here is that the survival curve is tapering off and possibly can't be improved further.

## Page 149
- The opioid epidemic may have been a driver of mortality deterioration in the 2010s
- There is no sign this trend will reverse


# 6. Wealth disparity 

- Greater wealth increases access to medical care, sanitation, and nutrition, but not always in a uniform way
- "A rising tide does not always lift all boats"
- Many countries have a "permanent underclass," which does not have similar access


## 7. War

- Trends 1, 3, and 5 above arguably increase the risk of war ${ }^{59}$
- Technological advancement can also make humans "more lethal"
- War can also reduce access to food, medicine, etc.

Trend 5 (alcohol/drugs) will likely apply to the US more than other countries
Some trends will affect insured populations differently than the general population
Limiting the use of underwriting may make insured mortality worse than the general population

- Already banned for individual health
- Casualty insurance restricts credit scoring
- Genetic life underwriting is illegal in some states


## Mortality-Indexed Life Insurance

In the final part of the paper, the authors propose a new type of life insurance product to mitigate the uncertainty of future mortality improvement. They don't really give it a concrete name. They refer to it as both a "mortality-indexed product" and a "life expectancy-indexed product." Either label is fine for exam purposes since graders will know what you're referring to.

One way insurers could reduce their risk of future mortality deterioration is to share the risk with policyholders using a product with premiums indexed to a mortality or life expectancy index

- If population life expectancy falls (rises), premiums would rise (fall)

Could have similarities to par or NGE products, but not the same

- Not a par product since no policyholder dividends involved
- Not an NGE since premiums would be based on an index, not the insurer's expectations

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{59}$ Curiously, the authors don't explain at all why they think this is so. Saying that long COVID might increase the risk of war seems like a bit of a reach.

## Page 150
Some degree of basis risk would remain: ${ }^{60}$

- Life expectancy at birth does not indicate future mortality slope
- Improvement will vary by sex and smoking status
- General population mortality data is more suitable for an index
- More available and objective than insured mortality data (if less relevant)

The first 2 points above could be addressed with more granular indexing

- E.g. using age- and/or gender-specific indexing

The life expectancy index chosen should be stable and predictable long-term

# An Example 

The authors looked at two hypothetical 30-term products: one with normal level premiums (non-indexed) and one with premiums indexed to mortality changes

- Premiums were set to achieve a $12 \%$ IRR and 13.1 PV profit per unit under the base scenario

The authors then compared the products over 3 scenarios:

1. $+2 \%$ annual mortality improvement:

- Indexed product: $12.0 \%$ IRR and 16.4 PV profit per unit
- Non-indexed product: $15 \%$ IRR and 25.0 PV profit per unit

2. $-2 \%$ annual mortality improvement (i.e. $2 \%$ mortality deterioration)

- Indexed product: $12.2 \%$ IRR and 10.4 PV profit per unit
- Non-indexed product: "N/A" IRR and -1.3 PV profit per unit ${ }^{61}$

3. $25 \%$ higher mortality in year $1,15 \%$ higher in year 2 , and $5 \%$ higher in years $3+$ :

- Indexed product: $11.9 \%$ IRR and 11.9 PV profit per unit
- Non-indexed product: 11.0 IRR and 11.2 PV profit per unit

Key interpretation: Results for the mortality-indexed product are much more stable
Factors not considered above that should be considered in a "true" pricing exercise:

## - Dynamic lapses

- Persistency might be worse for the indexed product if mortality deteriorates and premiums rise

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{60}$ The authors seem to use the phrase "basis risk" to refer to the risk that the adjustable premiums will still not fully mitigate uncertainty in mortality.
    ${ }^{61}$ The authors say "multiple sign changes in the profit stream prevent determination of a meaningful IRR."

## Page 151
- The authors believe this would be modest since policyholders should value their policy more as mortality worsens
- If premiums fall, persistency should increase as well
- Impact of principle-based reserves
- The analysis was based on CRVM reserves
- The deterministic/stochastic reserves for the indexed product would likely be higher than the non-indexed product
- Impact of the particular product specifications and assumptions
- This applies to virtually any product, however
- Even UL COI rates could be linked to a mortality index instead of being NGEs
