# Using the ODP Bootstrap Model: A Practitioner's Guide 

There are some minor typographical errors in Monograph 4 as published by the CAS in 2016:
To be consistent with the notation used in Section 4.3, the title of that section (on both the Contents page and page 23) should be:

### 4.3. Using an L-Year Weighted Average

On page 8, a $z$ parameter was left out of formula 3.5. The correct formula should be:

$$
E[q(w, d)]=m_{w, d} \text { and } \operatorname{Var}[q(w, d)]=\phi E[q(w, d)]^{2}=\phi m_{w, d}^{2}
$$

On page 12, in the paragraph at the top of the page and in footnote 16, the formula for $p=$ number of parameters should be:

$$
2 \times n-1
$$
