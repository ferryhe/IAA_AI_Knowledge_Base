## Chapter 29: Risk Based Capital

## Overview of This Reading

In the US, state regulators require insurance companies to hold a minimum level of capital that depends on the company's risk

The first half of the chapter covers the basic premise underlying the need for risk-based capital (RBC) and also the traditional factor-based approach to calculating RBC in the US

The second half of the chapter covers principles-based approaches to capital (C-3 Phase I and II), which were created in the 2000s to make the C-3 (interest rate risk) RBC component more dynamic

If you've worked with RBC concepts covered in this paper, it's likely you've seen some newer developments that have taken place after this book was published in 2018. As always, however, it's important to base any information used in exam questions on the current syllabus material!

## Key topics for the exam include:

- Goal of RBC and the RBC Model Act
- Ways that a company can restore surplus above target
- Know the 5 RBC risk categories (C-0 through C-4) and how the factors are applied for each
- How to calculate the RBC ratio
- RBC action levels
- RBC C-3 Phase I
- RBC C-3 Phase II


## General RBC Concepts and Calculation

## Introduction

The amount of stat surplus a company holds in important measure of the financial soundness of the company

Key question: What is appropriate amount of surplus?
A valuation task force in the 1970s classified risks into 4 categories:

1. Asset risk
2. Pricing risk
3. Interest rate risk

## Page 5
4. General business risk

# Goal of RBC 

Primary goal: Minimize the risk of insolvency and the cost of insolvency when it does occur
The RBC Model Act (1992) determines minimum amount of capital a life insurance company must have and requires various levels of regulatory action if reported surplus falls below certain thresholds

- Significantly increased capital requirements compared to the pre-1992 world
- Main driver of the model act: S\&L banking crisis of the 1980s—regulators were concerned the same could happen to the insurance industry

The NAIC defines RBC as "a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile"

## Target Surplus

Target surplus - varies by company but usually $\geq 3$ to 4 times the minimum RBC amount (company action level RBC)

If reported surplus falls below target amount, company can take action to restore it

- This will be clarified in the RBC ratio section later


## Ways That a Company Can Restore Surplus Above Target

- Emphasize products that have low RBC requirements and deemphasize products with high RBC requirements
- Redesign products to lower the RBC requirements
- Increase profitability by lowering expenses, exiting unprofitable LOBs, and/or increasing prices
- Reduce asset risk by buying assets with low RBC requirements and selling asset with high RBC requirements
- Reduce liability risks with reinsurance or sell certain product lines
- Reorganize the legal structure of the company by moving certain subsidiaries to a holding company
- Raise capital by issuing surplus notes or equity securities


## Moderately Adverse Conditions

SVL requires an Actuarial Opinion, for which the actuary has to consider whether reserves are tested under "moderately adverse conditions"

## Page 6
ASOP 22 provides guidance on what "moderately adverse conditions" means:
"Conditions that include one or more unfavorable, but not extreme, events that have a reasonable probability of occurring during the testing period"

The Academy's Life Capital Adequacy Subcommittee issued a report that provides further guidance on the probabilities associated with each level of conservatism on the insurer's balance sheet

- Min stat reserves under SVL should cover liabilities under $50 \%-70 \%$ of economic scenarios
- Min stat reserves + AVR and CFT results increase the confidence to $70 \%-90 \%$
- RBC requirements increase the confidence to $95 \%$

In other words, RBC requirements are intended to require enough assets over and above those held for stat reserves, AVR, and CFT provisions so that the company will be solvent $95 \%$ of the time

# RBC Factor Overview 

The RBC formula in the RBC Model Act applies factors to various annual statement entries to determine the RBC requirement for that particular entry

- RBC Requirement $=$ RBC Factor $\times$ Statement Value


## Example

For assets held by the company (e.g. bonds), the factors increase with the riskiness of the asset class, resulting in a higher RBC requirement for riskier assets

- Suppose a company has \$1M of NAIC Asset Class 1 bonds and \$1M of NAIC Asset Class 5 bonds
- Class 1 bonds have a factor of 0.004 , reflecting that they have lower credit risk than Class 5, which has a factor of 0.230
- RBC Requirement for Class $1=0.004 \times 1 \mathrm{M}=4,000$
- RBC Requirement for Class $5=0.230 \times 1 \mathrm{M}=230,000$
- As you would expect, the company needs to have a higher capital "cushion" for assets that are more likely to default

The RBC requirements for each statement item within each risk category (the "C's" discussed next) are added up to get the total RBC requirement for a given risk category (C-1, C-2, etc.)

About all those factors: This chapter shows many of the actual RBC factors for each type of risk. In reality, there are many, many more. You will certainly not be expected to memorize the factors for the exam. We've included many of the factors in the detailed study manual for reference just give a sense of the relative size of the factors. For the exam, it's more important to 1) understand why some factors might be higher than others due to increased risk and 2) how to work with the factors if they are given to arrive at the RBC requirement for a specific risk.

## Page 7
The next several sections cover the primary risk categories included in the RBC formula:

1. C-0: Asset Risk - Affiliates
2. C-1: Asset Risk - Other
3. C-2: Insurance Risk
4. C-3: Interest Rate Risk, Health Risk, and Market Risk
5. C-4: Business Risk
6. Other risk (included in C-1)

# C-0: Asset Risk - Affiliates 

- Intended to cover the risks of investments in affiliated companies (e.g. subsidiaries)
- If the affiliate is an insurance company, the C-0 requirement equals the affiliate's RBC
- Factors for non-insurance affiliates vary from $30 \%$ to $100 \%$ of the affiliate's book value


## C-1: Asset Risk - Other

- Based on risk of loss due to defaults on debt-style investments or fluctuations in the fair value of equity type investments
- Assets are divided into different classes: within each class, the RBC factors depend on quality of asset
- RBC factors are applied to asset statement values


## Major C-1 Asset Categories

1. Bonds

- NAIC developed the factors to be adequate $96 \%$ of the time under over a 10-year horizon under various economic conditions
- Factors vary by 7 NAIC asset classes: Exempt Obligations and NAIC Classes 1-6
- Exempt obligations (e.g. government-issued bonds) has a factor of $0 \%$
- Class 1 ("highest quality") has a factor of 0.004
- Class 6 (in or near default) has the highest factor at $30 \%$
- Factors are multiplied by a size adjustment based on number of issuers (see video lesson for numerical example)
- The purpose of the size adjustment is to reduce the RBC requirement for insurers who hold bonds from more issuers (i.e. less default risk concentrated in any one issuer)

2. Mortgages

## Page 8
- Factors vary from $0.14 \%$ to $23 \%$ and depend on:
- Borrower's standing (in good standing, 90 days overdue, in foreclosure)
- Type (farm, residential, or commercial)
- Whether or not the mortgage is insured or guaranteed

3. Preferred stock and common stock

- Affiliated preferred and common stock: use C-0
- Unaffiliated preferred stock: use same factors as for bonds (varies by NAIC asset class) but no size adjustment
- Unaffiliated common stock: Start with a 30\% factor, then make 2 additional adjustments:
- Beta-adjusted factor = the 30\% factor adjusted up or down by the company's common stock portfolio weighted average beta
* Bounded from $22.5 \%$ to $45.0 \%$
- Concentration adjustment = additional 50\% of the beta-adjusted requirement for the 5 largest holdings

4. Real estate

- Factor $=15 \%$ for real estate occupied by or invested in by company
- Factor $=23 \%$ for foreclosed real estate or real estate in Schedule BA

5. Other Schedule BA assets (other long-term invested assets)

- Factors vary from $0 \%$ (lowest risk) to $30 \%$ (highest risk)

6. Separate accounts - factors depend on whether or not the associated contracts offer guarantees (very technical and not covered in the reading)

Asset concentration factor - factors are doubled for the ten largest holdings

- Excludes various low-risk assets and also certain high-risk assets that already have a large factor


# C-2: Insurance Risk 

Covers risks like underestimating liabilities on existing business, inadequate pricing, and excessive claims

Factors are applied to Net Amount at Risk (NAR)

- $\mathrm{NAR}=$ Ordinary life insurance in force - policy reserves

The factors are applied in tiers and decline as the NAR increases

## Page 9
| NAR | Factor |
| :-- | :-- |
| First 500 million | 0.0023 |
| Next 4500 million | 0.0015 |
| Next 20,000 million | 0.0012 |
| Over 25,000 million | 0.0009 |

See the video lesson for a numerical example
The factors were developed by the NAIC to be sufficient to cover excess claims $95 \%$ of the time

# C-3: Interest Rate, Health, and Market Risk 

1. Interest rate risk - risk of loss due to either:

- Having to reinvest future cash flows in a falling interest rate environment
- Having to sell assets at below-statement values in a rising interest rate environment

2. Health risk - covers certain risks specific to health insurance providers (not discussed further in the reading)
3. Market risk - risk of loss on variable products with guarantees due to changes in market returns (this isn't given much coverage in the reading either)

C-3 factors for interest rate risk are applied to reserves (not NAR!) and vary depending on type of liability (less interest rate risk = lower factor):

- Low risk (factor $=0.77 \%$ )
- Life insurance reserves
- Annuities without withdrawal benefits
- Annuities with MVAs
- Life contingent payout annuities
- Medium risk (factor $=1.54 \%$ )
- Annuities with SCs $>5 \%$
- Reserves for structured settlements
- Supplementary contracts without life contingencies
- Dividend accumulations
- Any additional reserves from CFT
- High risk (factor $=3.08 \%$ )
- Reserves for annuities with SC $<5 \%$ or no SC at all

C-3 factors are increased by $50 \%$ if the company submits a qualified asset adequacy opinion

## Page 10
- A qualified Opinion means that the appointed actuary had to essentially put some conditions around the Opinion that make it less certain. An unqualified Opinion is always best from the perspective of a regulator.

The C-3 component also includes any additional RBC for interest rate risk determined under C-3 Phase I CFT (covered later)

# C-4: Business Risk 

Covers general business risks: fraud, mismanagement, and litigation
A C-4 factor of $3.08 \%$ is applied to premium income and annuity considerations in Schedule T
A C-4 factor of $0.08 \%$ is applied to separate account liabilities

## Other Risks (Included in C-1)

1. Risk of reinsurer insolvency (risk that that company may not be able to recover amounts due from a reinsurer)

- RBC requirement for reinsurance $=0.8 \% \times$ amount due from reinsurer
- Credit is given for certain types of reinsurance agreements to avoid overstatement of RBC

2. Risk of loss from off-balance sheet items (e.g. guarantees made on behalf of an affiliated company)

- Factor $=1.3 \%$


## RBC Ratio

A company's RBC ratio measures the amount of capital it has (subject to adjustments) relative to an authorized control level

$$
\text { RBC Ratio }=\frac{\text { Total Adj Capital }}{\text { Authorized Control Level RBC }}
$$

The authorized control level (ACL) $\mathbf{R B C}=$ the covariance-adjusted sum of the various RBC requirement amounts discussed earlier

$$
\mathrm{ACL} \mathrm{RBC}=0.5 \times\left[C_{0}+C_{4 a}+\sqrt{\left(C_{1 o}+C_{3 a}\right)^{2}+\left(C_{1 c s}+C_{3 c}\right)^{2}+C_{2}^{2}+C_{3 b}^{2}+C_{4 b}^{2}}\right]
$$

where:

- $C_{0}=$ Asset risk (affiliated amounts)
- $C_{1 c s}=$ Asset risk (unaffiliated common stock)
- $C_{1 o}=$ All other asset risk

## Page 11
- $C_{2}=$ Pricing (insurance) risk
- $C_{3 a}=$ Interest rate risk
- $C_{3 b}=$ Health credit risk
- $C_{3 c}=$ Market risk
- $C_{4 a}=$ Business risk (non-health portion)
- $C_{4 b}=$ Business risk (health portion)

Total adjusted capital $=$ stat surplus $+\mathrm{AVR}+\frac{1}{2}$ policyholder dividend liability
If the RBC ratio falls below a specified level, certain "action levels" are triggered

| Level | RBC ratio | Action |
| :-- | :--: | :-- |
| Trend Test Corridor | $[200 \%, 300 \%)$ | Company performs trend test |
| Company Action | $[150 \%, 200 \%)$ | Company prepares and submits an RBC plan <br> to commissioner |
| Regulatory Action | $[100 \%, 150 \%)$ | Company submits RBC plan; commissioner <br> will issue order specifying actions |
| Authorized Control | $[70 \%, 100 \%)$ | Commissioner authorized to take any <br> regulatory actions necessary |
| Mandatory Control | $<70 \%$ | Company is placed under regulatory control |

# Review of Steps to Calculate RBC Ratio 

1. Determine the RBC requirement for each statement amount within each of the "C" components

- RBC Factor $\times$ the appropriate statement amount defined for each risk

2. Total RBC requirement for each "C" component $=$ sum of all RBC requirement amounts within the component

- For example, for assets, you would total up all the different RBC amounts for bonds, mortgages, etc.

3. Calculate the RBC ratio by plugging in the total RBC requirement amount for each "C" in the formula

Starting on p. 280 of the reading, there is a large spreadsheet-like example of an RBC calculation. I recommend reviewing this example to help make the calculation of RBC amounts more concrete, but it is obviously much more calculation-intensive than anything you will encounter in an exam problem. The video lesson contains a more concise example that walks through each of the major "C" calculations as well as how to calculate the RBC ratio.

## Principles-Based Capital: C-3 Phase I and II

The industry has been moving away from the formula-based approaches to stat reserves and RBC toward more principles-based approach

## Page 12
- Recognizes increasing complexity of products
- You'll see more on principles-based approaches in the Emerging Standards section at the end of the online seminar


# RBC C-3 Phase I (2000) 

In December 2000, the NAIC adopted the Academy's proposal for RBC C-3 Phase I

- Required scenario testing to determine the C-3 requirement for interest-sensitive products
- Products affected: single premium life and fixed deferred annuities

C-3 Phase I requires the same CFT models/assumptions as used for the Actuarial Memorandum but with a different set of interest rate scenarios

The final C-3 requirement is based on a weighted average subset of the results of the scenario testing

## C-3 Phase I Steps

1. Start with the same models used for year-end CFT
2. Run a scenario set supplied by NAIC

- Can run a set of 50 or 12 scenarios
- Both sets are drawn from a larger set of 200 scenarios that are at intended to be at least as conservative as the full set of 200
- The set of 12 is more adverse than the set of 50

3. Capture the stat surplus result $(S(T))$ at year-end for each scenario

- $S(T)=$ Stat Assets - Stat Liabilities at EOY $T$

4. For each scenario, the C-3 measure $=$ most negative $\operatorname{PV}(S(T))$

- Discount rate $=105 \%$ of the after-tax 1-year Treasury rate for that scenario $\left(i_{s}\right)$

$$
\text { PV factor for year } T=\prod_{s=1}^{T} \frac{1}{1+i_{s}}
$$

5. Rank the C-3 measures in descending order

- 1st $=$ worst (most negative) scenario result from step 4
- 2nd $=2$ nd worst scenario result, etc.

6. C-3 requirement $=$ weighted average of a subset of the ranked C-3 measures

- Different weights are prescribed for each rank
- For the 50 scenario set: weighted average of C-3 measures ranked between 5 through 17

## Page 13
- Since \#11 is considered to be the 95th percentile, the idea is to center the weighting around \#11
- For the 12 scenario set: take the simple average of rank 2 and 3, but must be $\geq \frac{1}{2}$ rank 1

See video lesson for a numerical example

# Criteria to Exempt CFT for C-3 Phase I 

A company can exempt the above CFT requirement if it satisfies both of the following:

1. C-3 Significance Test: $\frac{C_{3}}{C_{0}+C_{1}+C_{2}+C_{3}+C_{4}}<40 \%$

- Indicates that interest rate risk is not significant

2. C-3 Stress Test:

- Calculate the covariance-adjusted RBC described earlier, but multiply the annuity C-3 interest rate component by 7.5
- If the resulting RBC ratio $>100 \%$, the company passes the stress test
- In other words, calculate the same RBC ratio as described earlier, but the annuity portion only of $C_{3 a}$ is scaled by 7.5. This increases the denominator of the RBC ratio, resulting in a lower ratio (requires more total adjusted capital than otherwise). This is also demonstrated in the video lesson.


## C-3 Phase II (2005)

In 2005, the NAIC adopted C-3 Phase II, which extended CFT requirements for C-3 risk to products with equity risk (VAs, etc.)

C-3 Phase II represented a significant shift from formula-based to principles-based methods and focused on determining a total asset requirement (TAR)

Historical note: VM-21 (covered in Section A of the course) was originally derived from an actuarial guideline (AG 43) that was based heavily on C-3 Phase II. Later, VM-21 was further revised and became even more complex, but many of the fundamental concepts in VM-21 can be traced back to the C-3 Phase II framework.

## Principles Behind C-3 Phase II

1. Principle 1: The objective of the TAR is to quantify the of stat capital needed by the insurer to be able to meet contractual obligations in light of risk exposure
2. Principle 2: TAR is based on results from a stochastic analysis of asset and liability cash flows

- For each scenario the greatest PV of accumulated stat deficiencies is calculated
- Reflect Prudent Best Estimate assumptions

## Page 14
3. Principle 3: The implementation of a model involves decisions about the experience assumptions and the modeling techniques to be used

- Assumptions should be conservative

4. Principle 4: Even though the stochastic cash flow model attempts to include all real world risks, it will still contain limitations because it is a model
5. Principle 5: Neither a cash flow scenario model or a method based on factors calibrated to the results of a cash flow scenario model can completely quantify an insurers exposure to risk

# Steps to Calculate C-3 Phase II 

1. Perform a stochastic simulation using prudent best estimate assumptions and probability distribution functions for equity returns that have been calibrated
2. For each scenario, the required capital $=\max \mathrm{PV}$ (accumulated deficiencies)
3. Sort the required capital for each scenario
4. Additional Asset Requirement (AAR) = the CTE 90 of required capital assets for the scenarios
5. $\mathrm{TAR}=\mathrm{AAR}+$ beginning assets
6. Final C-3 requirement $=$ TAR - statutory reserves

# ILA201-802: NAIC ORSA Guidance Manual 

Source Author: NAIC (December 2017)

## Overview of This Reading

As we have seen in other readings on the syllabus, ORSA is a key part of the US solvency regulation framework

As its name implies, ORSA ("own risk solvency assessment"), is a solvency assessment done by insurers (and insurer groups) themselves

However, ORSA is a process required by the NAIC, so while insurers are doing an assessment of themselves, the NAIC provides guidance and rules

This study note is the actual current ORSA guidance manual that US insurers use to comply with ORSA in the US

Key topics for the exam include:

- Overview of ORSA requirements and primary goals
- ORSA exemption and waiver rules
- Major areas of the ORSA Summary Report and general requirements
- Key principles of an ERM framework (5)
- Purpose and content of ORSA Summary Report Sections 1-3


## Introduction

ORSA is a component of an insurer's ERM framework:

- A confidential internal assessment appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity of an insurer, conducted by that insurer of the material and relevant risks


## Insurer Requirements

- Regularly conduct ORSA to assess adequacy of risk management framework and current and estimated projected future solvency position
- Do at least annually
- Internally document the process and results of assessment
- Provide a confidential, high-level ORSA Summary Report annually to state commissioners and domiciliary state regulator (if requested)


## Primary Goals of ORSA

1. Foster an effective level of ERM at all insurers

- Identify, assess, monitor, prioritize and report on material and relevant risks identified by the insurer

## Page 16
- Use appropriate techniques for the nature, scale and complexity of the risks
- Should support risk and capital decisions

2. Provide a group-level perspective on risk and capital, as a supplement to the existing legal entity view

# Exemption From ORSA Requirements 

Insurers are exempt from doing ORSA if (both):

1. Insurer's annual direct written and unaffiliated assumed premium $<\$ 500$ million
2. Insurer's group's annual direct written and unaffiliated premium $<\$ 1$ billion

## If satisfy \#1 but not \#2:

- Submit ORSA Summary Report in any combination as long as every insurer within the group is covered by the ORSA Summary Report(s)


## If satisfy \#2 but not \#1:

- Submit only the ORSA Summary Report required for the individual insurer Regardless of exemption status, commissioners can still require an ORSA Summary Report in certain situations:
- Unique circumstances arising from type of business written, organizational structure, federal agency requests, regulatory concerns, or risk exposure
- If insurer triggers an RBC company action level, is in hazardous financial condition, or exhibits qualities of a troubled insurer

If a previously exempt insurer fails the exemption (writes more premium), the insurer has 1 year to comply with ORSA requirements

## Application For Waiver

Insurers who don't meet exemption may apply for a waiver from the requirements Commissioner may consider factors such as type of business, volume of business written, and material reduction in risk or risk exposures

## General ORSA Guidance

ORSA should be one element of insurer's ERM framework
The Commissioner will use ORSA Summary Report to gain high-level understanding of the insurer's ORSA

ORSA will be supported by the insurer's internal risk management materials
Major Areas of ORSA Summary Report (described in more detail later)

- Section 1 - Description of the Insurer's Risk Management Framework

## Page 17
- Section 2 - Insurer's Assessment of Risk Exposure
- Section 3 - Group Assessment of Risk Capital and Prospective Solvency Assessment Content should be consistent with ERM information reported to senior management and the board of directors
- But does not need to be exactly the same medium or level of detail as the report supplied to the Board

ORSA Summary Report should identify:

- Accounting basis for the report (GAAP, stat, IFRS)
- Date or time period that the report represents
- Scope of the ORSA—which insurers are included
- Short summary of any material changes from prior year

Commissioner may develop a deeper understanding of the insurer's ERM framework upon examination

- May also request additional materials to supplement: underwriting, investment, claims, asset-liability management, reinsurance policies

Must be filed annually, but exact timing will vary from insurer to insurer
Must be signed by insurer's CRO or other executive who oversees the ERM process
Must be written in English
Report should represent all of the insurer's material risks
Insurer should also internally document the ORSA results to facilitate a more in-depth review by the commissioner, if applicable

# ORSA Manual Maintenance Process 

The Group Solvency Issues (E) Working Group or designated subgroup handles proposed changes, amendments or modifications to ORSA manual

## Procedures for Working Group for Changes to ORSA Manual:

1. Proposals for change can be considered at any conference call, interim or national meeting throughout the year
2. Proposals submitted for changes or filed with NAIC staff support may be considered at next regularly scheduled group meeting
3. Working group publishes a formal submission form and instructions to submit proposals (but proposals can also be submitted in alternate format if concise and complete)
4. Proposals effective Jan. 1 of following year (if adopted by Working Group in Summer meeting and adopted by NAIC in Fall meeting)

## Page 18
5. Proposals will be reviewed for next scheduled meeting to consider it for adoption

- Must be exposed for public comments for at least 30 days, then Working Group will consider comments
- Proposals under consideration may be deferred until next scheduled meeting

6. NAIC support staff prepares agenda including proposed changes

- Agenda sent to Working Group, and interested regulators and parties 5-10 business days before scheduled meeting to consider proposal

7. Exceptions: suggested changes can be considered as exceptions from above process if approved by $2 / 3$ majority of Working Group

- Must still be exposed for public comments

8. NAIC support staff publishes Manual around December 15 each year

- Current version and any revisions posted to Working Group and NAIC Publications Web sites


# Section 1 - Description of the Insurer's ERM Framework 

## Key Principles of an Effective ERM Framework

1. Risk Culture and Governance

- Clearly defines roles / responsibilities
- Culture should support accountability in risk-based decision making


## 2. Risk Identification and Prioritization

- A process that is key to the organization - Responsibility is clear
- Risk management function is responsible for ensuring that the process is appropriate and functioning properly


## 3. Risk Appetite, Tolerance, and Limits

- Formal risk appetite statement and associated risk tolerances and limits
- Understanding of the risk appetite statement ensures alignment with risk strategy of the board of directors


## 4. Risk Management and Controls

- Managing risk is an ongoing ERM activity, operating at many levels within the organization


## 5. Risk Reporting and Communication

- Key constituents get transparency into the risk management process and facilitate active, informal decisions on risk-taking and management


## ORSA Section 1 Items

## Page 19
1. Provide a high-level overview of the 5 ERM principles above
2. Describe how insurer identifies and categorizes relevant and material risks and manages them
3. Describe risk-monitoring processes and methods, provide risk appetite statements and explain risk tolerances and the amount and quality of risk capital
4. Identify assessment tools used to monitor and respond to changes in risk profile
5. Describe how insurer incorporates new risk information to monitor and respond to changes in risk profile

The manner and depth in which the insurer addresses these principles is dependent upon its own risk management processes

# Section 2: Insurer Assessment of Risk Exposures 

Provide a high level summary of how risk exposure was assessed for both normal and stressed environments for each material risk category in Section 1

- Should consider a range of outcomes
- Examples of relevant risks: credit, market, liquidity, underwriting, and operational risks

May include detailed descriptions and explanations of:

- Material and relevant risks
- Assessment methods used
- Key assumptions
- Risk-mitigation activities
- Outcomes of any plausible adverse scenarios assessed

Assessment of each risk's future impact should depend on its specific characteristics

- May use simple stress tests or more complex stochastic analyses
- Evaluate under normal and stressed environments
- Consider the impact of stresses on capital
- Analysis should be conducted consistent with how the business is managed
- Stress tests may be performed at a group level

Risk tolerance statements should include:

- Material quantitative and qualitative risk tolerance limits
- How the tolerance statements and limits are determined

Each insurer should utilize assessment techniques applicable to its risk profile

## Page 20
- U.S. regulators do not believe there is a standard set of stress conditions that each insurer should test
- Commissioner may provide input regarding the level of stress that the insurer should consider for each category

Goal: Evaluating each material risk category independently under normal and stressed conditions allows management and commissioner to better evaluate risk combinations that could cause the insurer to fail

- Very difficult to determine relationships between risk categories


# Section 3: Group Risk and Prospective Solvency Assessment 

Purpose: Describes how insurer combines the qualitative elements of its risk management policy with the quantitative measures of risk exposure to determine the level of financial resources needed to manage the current business and over a longer term business cycle (e.g. 1-3 yrs)

## Group Risk Assessment

Compare aggregate available capital to the various risks that may adversely affect the enterprise

- Goal is to provide an overall determination of risk capital needs for the insurer, based upon nature, scale and complexity of risk and risk appetite
- Should not be perceived as minimum RBC, but instead as capital needed to achieve business objectives

Insurer should have sound processes to assess capital adequacy in relation to its risk profile

- Should be integrated into the management and decision-making culture
- Should assess risk over varying time horizons, valuation approaches and capital management strategies For group capital assessment:
- Should include and explain changes in risk capital since the prior year
- Should describe approach used in the analysis to assess risk capital and adequacy

## Page 21
Examples of key methodologies / assumptions / considerations that should be described

|  | Example |
| :-- | :-- |
| Definition of Solvency | Cash flow basis; balance sheet basis |
| Accounting or Valuation Regime | GAAP; Stat.; Economic or market consistent; IFRS |
| Business Included | Positions as of a valuation date; new business <br> assumptions |
| Time Horizon | One year; multi-year; lifetime; run-off |
| Risks Modeled | Credit; market; liquidity; operational; insurance |
| Quantification Method | Deterministic stress tests; stochastic models; factor <br> based analysis |
| Risk Capital Metric | Value-at-Risk (VAR); Tail Value-at-Risk |
| Defined Security Standard | AA solvency; 99.X\% 1-yr VAR; Y\% Tail VAR or CTE; <br> X\% of RBC |
| Aggregation and Diversification | Correlation matrix; dependency structure |

# Approach and Assessment of Group-Wide Capital Adequacy Considerations 

- Elimination of intra-group transactions and double-gearing where same capital is used simultaneously as a buffer against risk in two entities
- Level of leverage from holding company debt, if any
- Diversification credits and restrictions on the fungibility (ability to be substituted for) of capital within the holding company
- Contagion risk effects, concentration risk and complexity risk
- Liquidity risk effects or calls on the insurer's cash position


## Prospective Solvency Assessment

Capital assessment process should be closely tied to business planning
Insurer should have robust capital forecasting capability that supports its management of risk over time horizon, in line with stated risk appetite

The prospective solvency assessment should:

- Consider material and relevant changes, normal and stressed conditions
- Demonstrate financial resources to execute multi-year business plan
- If insurer does not have necessary capital, describe the management actions it will take/has taken to remedy any capital adequacy concerns


## Prospective solvency assessment is a feedback loop

- Insurer should project future financial position
- Include current risk profile, risk management policy, and quality and level of capital

## Page 22
Includes capital projections and a discussion of prospective risks impacting the capital projections

- Should address whether risk exposures are expected to change in the future and steps to mitigate
- If performed for each individual insurer, the assessment should account for any risk associated with group membership

## Overview of This Reading

This SOA research paper defines the concept of economic capital and describes various aspects of it

Over the years, the SOA has removed sections of this paper from the syllabus; the sections that remain on the current syllabus serve to provide a very basic overview of economic capital and its applications

Key topics for the exam include:

- Available vs. required capital
- How to describe/define economic capital
- Applications of EC


## 2. Background and Scope

## Definitions

Differences in the value of capital arise due to:

- Accounting differences (GAAP, Stat, FV, economic)
- Inclusion of different subsets of the assets and liabilities and different methodologies being applied to value the assets and liabilities


## Available vs. required capital

- Available capital = total available capital (Assets - Liabilities under any given accounting convention)
- Required capital = capital needed to support the business (not available to distribute outside of the business)
- This is the denominator in a capital ratio


## What is economic capital (EC)?

- Most agree EC that is based on the most realistic assessment of future risks
- Opinion on the approach for calculating EC varies
- Long-term projection approaches
- Shorter horizon (e.g. 1 year) approaches

## Page 25
- Hybrid approaches

Some equate an economic valuation with market-consistent or fair valuation of liabilities, but others argue against this saying:

1. FV is inappropriate for many types of life insurance liabilities
2. Short-term MV volatility is inappropriate for long-term economic risk measurement
3. FV doesn't appropriately recognize the long-term nature of insurers' business and ability to hold assets and liabilities for the long-term

The authors recommend measuring EC consistently with the "economics of the company"

- Account for the insurer's objectives, business plan, management actions, constraints, economic circumstances, and regulatory regime

The level of capital must balance the objectives of the insurer and its stakeholders:

- Policyholders
- Regulators
- Rating agencies
- Shareholders

Holding more capital will generally give the company more flexibility and protection against unforeseen events

- Avoids ruinous events and frictional costs of financial distress
- May increase franchise value by attracting more profitable business

The optimal level of capital is the level that maximizes the insurer's return on capital

- ROC increases as capital is increased above the minimum required for policyholder liabilities
- Eventually ROC falls as more capital is added

Economic capital - amount of capital required by a company to ensure that certain goals are met with a high degree of certainty under a realistic assessment of future risk

Regulatory economic capital - EC calculated primarily for a regulator (e.g. Solvency II)

# 6. Applications of Economic Capital 

## 1. Capital Adequacy

- Core use of EC for most insurers
- How to use most effectively:

## Page 26
- Integrate EC into capital management process
- Develop bands within which targeted capital should fall (else take action)
- Used by rating agencies and other stakeholders


# 2. Capital Allocation 

- Aggregate capital must be allocated to risk drivers
- Should result in additive capital: sum of capital held at LOB equals total optimal capital
- 2 methods for allocating capital:
(a) Pro-rata - allocate total capital in proportion to standalone amounts
- Advantage: simplest method (doesn't require stochastic)
- Disadvantage: assumes all LOBs have similar risk profiles
(b) Euler method - solves for scenarios that produce the total capital required
- Advantage: the scenarios more accurately identify risk drivers
- Disadvantage: requires many simulations and harder to explain


## 3. Risk Appetite

- EC can be used to set quantitative target ranges and limits for risk taking
- EC can be used with broader capital objectives organized into tiers
- Example:
* Tier 1: meet policyholder cash flows with $95 \%$ confidence
* Tier 2: meet debt payments with $90 \%$ confidence
* Tier 3: ensure regulatory capital ratio $\geq 200 \%$ with $90 \%$ confidence
- Disadvantages of holding more capital:
* Increases frictional costs (tax, investment expense)
* Reduces the value of shareholders put option (their right to walk away on insolvency)
- Disadvantage of multi-tier capital: requires more model sophistication


## 4. Performance Measurement

- Higher risk business units generally have more EC allocated (expect higher return)
- EC itself does not measure business performance
- EC can be combined with return measures to create performance metrics:

## Page 27
(a) Return on Risk-Adjusted Capital $(\mathrm{RORAC})=$
Economic Return

In practice GAAP earnings are often used as the return measure even though they are not an "economic" measure (so use with caution)
(b) Embedded value (EV) - based on the PV of distributable earnings, which could use EC as the basis for required capital

# 5. Strategic Planning 

- As EC is adopted more, it creates incentive to pursue diversification benefits (e.g. extend geographical reach to have lower required capital per region)
- EC should not be used as the only metric (better to combine with return measures)
- Resource constraints can make it challenging to project EC requirements for a large number of strategic options


## 6. Pricing

- EC has not been used much for pricing, but this may change in the future


## 7. Mergers \& Acquisitions

- Buyers may be more likely to purchase companies that can add diversification benefits
- E.g. a company with mostly term life insurance may purchase a company with longevity products like payout annuities or pensions
- Buyers also need to understand increased capital requirements if they buy a lowerrated company
- Sellers should understand how their overall risk profile will change when selling a block of business (may lose diversification benefits)

## Overview of This Reading

This is a very dense but well written paper on the topic of "risk capital"
When this paper was written (early 90s), people were not using the phrase "economic capital" yet, but that's essentially what this paper is getting at

One thing that makes this paper unique is that it's packed with quantitative topics that don't lend themselves to formula-based memorization

The short length of the detailed study manual material (and page count of the article itself) are deceptive: there is a lot to unpack here, and you may want to just go straight to the video lesson

It's critical to work through numerical examples so that you understand what you need to know for the exam, and the video lesson is extremely comprehensive in this regard

## Key topics for the exam include:

- Definition and distinguish features of principal financial firms
- Definition of risk capital vs. other definitions of capital
- Understand the key points of all examples in the paper (see video lesson)
- How to determine the amount of risk capital
- Impact of capital financing
- Levels of financing seniority
- Concept of "asset insurance" and who can provide it
- Economic cost of risk
- How to allocation marginal risk capital


## Distinguishing Features of Principal Financial Firms

This paper is focuses on principal financial firms (firms making financial decisions on behalf of their customers)

- "Customer" is a very generic term for an entity or individual whose money is essentially being protected/managed by a firm like a bank, insurer, etc. Policyholders are the most relevant example of a "customer" in the context of this exam.


## Principal financial firms (PFFs ${ }^{1}$ ) have 3 distinguishing features:

1. Credit-sensitivity of customers puts high emphasis on solvency
[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ The reading does not use this acronym so I would probably define it if you need to write the phrase "principal financial firm" over and over in an solution.

## Page 29
- Customers tend to be more credit-sensitive - i.e. prefer solvency so their contracts stay intact
- Investors (i.e. shareholders) tend to be less credit-sensitive - i.e. more focused on P\&L
- The more credit-sensitive the customer, the more important risk management is from a competitive standpoint (e.g. AAA-rate insurers will attract better risks than A-rated insurers)

2. Opaqueness to customers and investors - increases agency and information costs ("economic costs of risk capital")

- Monitoring a PFF's balance sheet can be difficult (can change quickly with relatively little notice/explanation)
- PFFs are subject to major event risk
- Also increases importance of risk management

3. Profitability is highly sensitive to the cost of risk capital

- Decentralized PFFs find it challenging to allocate risk capital
- Higher risk BUs should have more capital allocated, but it is difficult to quantify (must be imputed)
- E.g. a life insurance contract doesn't require an immediate benefit payment, but it can only be sold if the policyholder believes the insurer can honor it in the future


# Defining Capital 

Risk capital - the smallest amount that can be invested to insure the value of the firm's net assets against a loss in value relative to the risk-free investment of those net assets

Net assets $=$ gross assets minus customer liabilities (valued as if these liabilities are default-free)

- Volatility of net assets is the most important determinant of the amount of risk capital
- Contingent liabilities - increase risk in net assets
- Risk comes from uncertainty in liabilities and covariance between assets and liabilities

The amount of risk capital depends only on the riskiness of net assets, and not at all on the form of financing of the net assets

Risk capital is different from other measures of capital like:

- Regulatory capital - capital according to a particular accounting standard
- Cash capital - up-front cash required to execute a transaction
- Typically large for purchase of physical securities

## Page 30
- Typically small or zero for derivatives (e.g. futures and repos)
- Can be negative for insurance ${ }^{2}$
- Working capital (a component of cash capital) - includes financing of operating expenses like salaries and rent


# Examples 

This section contains hypothetical examples labeled $A, B, C$, etc. These examples are critical to understand for the exam and are fairly intellectually challenging to fully digest, especially if you are short on time in your study schedule. They are also very difficult to describe verbally. Therefore, it's very important to go through the video lesson, which covers these examples in depth and also breaks them into easier to understand segments.

## Three Basic Functions of Capital Providers

1. Provide cash capital
2. Sell asset insurance
3. Provision of risk capital, which is the cash required for the purchase of asset insurance

By the time you go through the examples in the paper and/or video lesson, these 3 functions will be much clearer conceptually.

## Contingent Customer Liabilities

Contingent customer liabilities can increase the risk in net assets if gross assets are not well matched to the liabilities

For example, suppose a liability is indexed to the S\&P 500

- If gross assets are invested in Treasuries, net assets are extremely risky even though gross assets are risk-free
- If gross assets are invested in the S\&P 500, net assets are risk-free even though the gross assets are risky
- If gross assets are invested in something that imperfectly tracks the S\&P 500, the risk in net assets is based on the tracking error of the gross assets


## Accounting for Risk Capital in the Calculation of Profits

Asset insurance is a financial asset and a part of risk capital

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ The authors are not talking about the kind of "insurance" we normally deal with on the ILA track here. This is more of a general reference any entity that agrees to pay a "claim" in the future if some event occurs. In the context of the examples later, this can take the form of credit or bond insurance, where the "insurer" collects an upfront premium (i.e. has a cash inflow) and may or may not have to pay claims in the future. Hence, the upfront cost is "negative."

## Page 31
If the purchase of insurance is omitted in risk capital, it will:

- Overstate profits when the underlying assets perform well (because the insurance expires worthless)
- Understate profits when the underlying assets perform poorly (because the insurance becomes valuable)

To reflect insurance risk capital in ROE, the numerator (income) should reflect the cost of insurance, and the denominator should include the risk capital

$$
\text { ROE }=\frac{\text { Pre-Tax Income }- \text { Cost of Insurance }}{\text { Cash Capital }+ \text { Risk Capital }}
$$

This is particularly important at the BU level because decisions on how much risk capital to allocate to a given BU can greatly impact that BU's ROE

# The Economic Cost of Risk Capital 

When calculating profit ex post (after the fact), the value of the insurance is known (i.e. it either paid off or it didn't)

When calculating profits ex ante (i.e. making a forecast or estimate of profit), we don't know whether the insurance will payoff or not

Therefore, estimates of future profits should include only the economic cost of insurance
Economic Cost $=$ Actual Insurance Premium Paid - Actuarial Fair Value of Insurance
In other words, a firm is simultaneously recognizing a financial asset based on the fair value
The cost over the FV may be referred to as a "bid-ask spread" and can be expressed as a \% of the risk capital

- E.g. if the insurance risk capital costs 500 and the actuarial FV is 470 , the economic cost of this capital is $30 / 500=6 \%$

The higher the economic cost of capital, the more profits the firm must earn to cover it

## Sources of Economic Costs

Economic costs arise from information risks and agency risks

- Adverse selection - the risk that insurers can't distinguish "good" from "bad" risks
- Moral hazard - the risk that investors will increase their asset risk after they've insured their asset (risk is higher if insurer can't monitor the insured)
- Agency costs - loss of asset values through inefficiency or mismanagement
- Mostly borne by equityholders since they have a residual claim

## Page 32
PFFs are more opaque (less transparent) and therefore have higher information and agency costs Therefore PFFs tend to have a higher economic cost of capital than other firms

PFF management must determine how to weigh the spread costs of different sources of asset insurance

- Too much equity results in high cost of capital due to high agency risk borne by investors
- More debt (leverage) can reduce agency costs but increase moral hazard (more debt = more asset insurance assumed by debtholders, so management can get riskier)

Signaling costs - cost incurred by firms that try to make themselves appear more transparent

- May require marking assets to market and/or disclosing propriety strategies
- Higher transparency = less competitive advantage, which is a cost

PFF management has to balance:

1. Paying higher spread costs of risk capital
2. Paying signaling costs for transparency

# Hedging and Risk Management 

Hedging market exposures (interest rate, equity, etc.) reduces the required amount of risk capital Firms that speculate on the direction of the market will generally require more risk capital Hedging reduces net asset risk, which can reduce risk capital

If there are no spread costs for risk capital, firms may be indifferent to hedging

- Large risk capital amounts would not increase cost

Otherwise, if risk capital does have spread costs, firms have incentive to reduce risk capital by hedging

## Capital Allocation and Capital Budgeting

If businesses are not perfectly correlated with one another, there will be a diversification benefit

- Combining imperfectly correlated BUs can reduce overall risk capital
- The sum of the standalone risk capital > combined risk reflecting correlations
- Diversification benefits increase from zero as correlations move away from 1.0 to -1.0

It is therefore possible for BUs to be profitable in aggregate even if some BUs are not profitable on a standalone basis

## Marginal Risk Capital

## Page 33
The reading shows an example of how to quantify marginal risk capital using a correlation matrix approach similar to what we've seen in other readings pertaining to economic capital (the standard variance-covariance approach). However, this reading does not show the usual formulas for doing this (which we are showing below).

$$
\text { Combined } \mathrm{RC}=\sqrt{\sum_{i} \sum_{j} \rho_{i j} \mathrm{RC}_{i} \mathrm{RC}_{j}}
$$

For 2 BUs, this simplifies to:

$$
\text { Combined } \mathrm{RC}=\sqrt{\mathrm{RC}_{1}^{2}+\mathrm{RC}_{2}^{2}+2 \rho \cdot \mathrm{RC}_{1} \cdot \mathrm{RC}_{2}}
$$

Instead, the authors use a Black-Scholes approximation that results in essentially an identical result:

$$
\text { Combined } \mathrm{RC} \approx A A_{0} \sigma \cdot \sqrt{T}
$$

This is explained more in the technical appendix and in the video lesson
Marginal risk capital of BU $i=A-B$ where:

- $A=$ Combined RC for all BUs
- $B=$ Combined RC for all BUs except BU $i$

The marginal RC for each BU can then be allocated to that BU

# Unallocated Risk Capital 

If correlations are on $(1,-1]$, there will be a diversification benefit-hence there will be some capital left over after allocating all marginal RC amounts

The amount of unallocated RC will be higher for firms with:

- More BUs
- BUs with lower correlations

In other words, a firm with many imperfectly correlated BUs will have greater diversification benefits than a firm with a small number of BUs with high correlations

Therefore, for a large firm, unallocated RC could be quite large
Nonetheless, RC allocated to each BU should be based on marginal RC for that BU-otherwise, it will overstate that BU's contribution to aggregate RC and inflate the economic cost of RC for that BU (resulting in the wrong profit measurement)

## Riskiness of net assets vs. value of net assets:

- Riskiness of net assets is affected by correlations among business units
- Value net assets is affected by their correlation with the broad market

## Page 34
# Important Conclusions 

- Amount of risk capital is uniquely determined by the riskiness of the net assets
- The form of the financing of net assets does not impact the risk capital
- Risk capital funds are provided by the firm's residual claimants (usually shareholders)
- Other parties for asset insurance include:
- Third-party guarantors
- Firm's stakeholders
- Customers
- Debtholders
- Economic costs of risk = the spreads on the price of asset insurance that stem from information costs (moral hazard and adverse selection) and agency costs
- The risk capital of a firm is less than or equal to the aggregate risk capital of the standalone businesses


## Technical Appendix - Part I

The appendix material is included on the syllabus. The SOA actually tested it when this reading was on the old LRM syllabus (Fall 2015 LRM Q1). At a minimum, I would just memorize the risk capital approximation formula shown below.

Black-Scholes approximation for risk capital $\approx .4 A_{0} \sigma \cdot \sqrt{T}$

- $A_{0}=$ value of gross assets at time 0
- $\sigma=$ standard deviation of $A / L$, where $L=$ value of customer liabilities
- If customer liabilities are fixed, $\sigma=$ standard deviation of gross assets

The double summation is over all $i$ such that $i \neq j$
The approximation can be used for 1 asset (BU) or multiple BUs combined
If using for multiple BUs, you must first calculate the variance of the combination:

$$
\sigma^{2}=\sum_{i} w_{i}^{2} \sigma_{i}^{2}+\sum_{i} \sum_{j} w_{i} w_{j} \sigma_{i} \sigma_{j} \rho_{i, j}
$$

The standard deviation is based on the square root of this variance

## Technical Appendix - Part II

## Two Main Aggregation Facts

## Page 35
1. The sum of the risk capital of stand-alone businesses exceeds the risk capital of the businesses combined in one firm
2. The risk capital of a combination of businesses exceeds the sum of the marginal risk capital of each of those businesses

# Jensen's Inequality 

- Jensen's Inequality states that: If $f$ is a convex function and $x$ is a random variable then $E(f(x)) \geq f(E(x))$
- Convex Functions:
- One common example of a convex function is an option payoff
$-f\left(X_{i}\right)=\max \left(X_{i}, 0\right)$ is a convex function


## Sample Proof of Fact \#1

- Let $X_{i}$ be the shortfall for business $i$
- Denote $f\left(X_{i}\right)=\max \left(X_{i}, 0\right)$ as the insurance payoff
- Note that the function $f$ is convex, so Jensen's inequality can be applied
- Sum of the risk capital of stand-alone businesses: $\sum f\left(X_{i}\right)$
- Combined risk capital: $f\left(\sum X_{i}\right)$
- By Jensen's Inequality, $\sum f\left(X_{i}\right) \geq f\left(\sum X_{i}\right)$
- Therefore, the sum of the risk capital of stand-alone businesses exceeds the risk capital of the businesses combined in one firm

# Rating Agency Perspectives on Insurance Company Capital 

Source Author: SOA Research Institute (August 2023)

## Overview of This Reading

This paper gives an overview of the primary rating agencies that assign financial strength and credit ratings to insurers

Rating agencies each have their own methodologies for determining how much capital an insurer should have, and generally, the more capital an insurer has, the higher its assigned rating

## Key topics for the exam include:

- Rating types, process, scales, and applications
- Factors used in insurance rating methodologies
- General methodology used by each agency:

1. AM Best
2. Fitch
3. Moody's
4. S\&P

- Common adjustments in available capital


## Introduction

## Rating Agencies

Credit rating agency - provides a forward-looking opinion on an entity or security issuer's ability to meet its obligations

First appeared following a financial crisis in the mid-1800s
Today, there are 10 Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs)
This paper focuses on 4 agencies that rate insurers: AM Best, Fitch Ratings, Moody's, and S\&P

## Rating Types Relevant to Insurers

1. Financial strength rating (FSR) - an insurer's ability to meet ongoing policyholder claims and contract obligations

- Higher for insurers with sufficient available assets and liquidity

2. Issuer credit rating (ICR) - an insurer's credit risk related to obligations to other creditors

FSR is "notched" higher than ICR because policyholders are senior to other creditors if an insurer defaults

- "Notching" is the practice of giving different credit ratings to an issuer's different obligations

## Page 37
- Reflects an issue's seniority (priority if default occurs)

Agencies issue ratings for both individual insurers and insurance groups

- Group ratings may be based on the largest insurer or consolidated across the group


# Rating Process 

Each agency has its own methodology and criteria
The SEC requires agencies to review their methodology/criteria every 12 months

- Includes backtesting, model calibration, ratio guidelines, and model validation

The process starts when an insurer requests ratings from an agency

- Agencies assign dedicated analysts to each rated entity
- Analysts meet with insurers regularly to review factors affecting ratings

How insurers manage relationships with agencies:

- Larger insurers use cross-functional teams
- Teams include professionals from investments, capital management, finance, and actuarial
- Smaller insurers have more limited teams with similar expertise

The insurer and agency exchange qualitative and quantitative information

- Data sources: statutory filings, GAAP financial statements, and investor materials
- Also involves a comprehensive survey of the insurer's operation
- Strategy, distribution, underwriting, reserving, investments, claims, ERM
- Agencies can withdraw from the review if they can't obtain the necessary information

Rating analysts propose ratings to an internal committee for review and voting

- Committees ensure consistency and maintain the rating process's integrity

Insurers receive a pre-publication rationale for fact-checking
Ratings are monitored regularly and updated semi-annually or annually
Updates occur when significant developments or events take place

## Rating Scales

Each agency uses a different rating scale
Scales typically range from A to D, with A representing the highest quality
Additional modifiers like plus or minus signs indicate relative status within categories

- E.g. A+ is higher than A, which is higher than A-

Agencies publish an outlook indicating potential rating trends

## Page 38
- Outlook options include positive, negative, stable, or developing
- Considers factors affecting the insurer's balance sheet, management, and broader industry
- An outlook may or may not lead to a rating change

Example of the rating syntax used by different agencies:

| AM Best FSR | AM Best ICR | Fitch Ratings | Moody's | S\&P Global |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| A++, A+ | aaa, aa+, aa, aa- | AAA, AA+, AA, AA- | Aaa, Aa1, Aa2, Aa3 | AAA, AA+, AA, AA- |
| A, A- | a+, a, a- | A+, A, A- | A1, A2, A3 | A+, A, A- |
| B++, B+ | bbb+, bbb, bbb- | BBB+, BBB, BBB- | Baa1, Baa2, Baa3 | BBB+, BBB, BBB- |
| B, B- | bb+, bb, bb- | BB+, BB, BB- | Ba1, Ba2, Ba3 | BB+, BB, BB- |
| C++, C+ | b+, b, b- | B+, B, B- | B1, B2, B3 | B+, B, B- |
| C, C- | ccc+, ccc, ccc-, cc | CCC+, CCC, CCC-, CC | Caa1, Caa2, Caa3, Ca | CCC+, CCC, CCC-, CC |
| D | c | C | C | C |
| E | d, e | D |  | D |
| F | f |  |  |  |

# Insurance Rating Applications 

How insurers use ratings:

- Attract new customers; increase consumer confidence
- Access certain markets and/or distribution channels
- Assess counterparty risk in reinsurers, which affects collateral requirements
- Set target rating levels, which drive
- Investment portfolio strategy
- Other business decisions and management discussions
- Target capital levels

How other parties use ratings:

- Investors and lenders: investment, lending, and pricing decisions related to insurers
- Impacts an insurer's ability to raise capital and its cost of capital
- Regulators: define investment classifications and capital charges


## Insurance Rating Methodology

Each rating agency has its own rating methodology and criteria
Criteria are tailored to the insurance industry, with variations for sub-sectors

- Includes quantitative and qualitative measures, economic and regulatory factors
- Analysis includes peer comparisons, industry standards, and operating plans
- Key factors assessed: ERM, corporate governance, and support from parent or affiliates

## Page 39
Rating agencies set thresholds for major rating categories
Exceptions to methodology and factors leading to rating changes are detailed in reports
All agencies consider similar core and additional factors in their rating criteria

# Core Factors 

1. Balance sheet strength - foundation of financial security

- Capital adequacy - each agency uses its own proprietary model
- Focuses on the statutory regime for US insurers
- Some approaches are factor-based; others stochastic
- Examples of stress events considered: economic, biometric, policyholder behavior, catastrophe
- Investment/ALM strategy - asset allocation, liquidity, credit quality, diversification, future investment strategy, and more
- Gauges risks related to interest rates, credit spreads, default, nonpayment, and prepayment
- Focus areas: ALM, cash flow mismatches, and duration matching
- Key metrics: asset allocation, credit rating allocation, high-risk asset ratio, intangibles ratio, and interest rate duration mismatch
- Review of investment guidelines to understand risk appetite and diversification/concentration
- Assessment of insurer's reliance on investment returns to supplement underwriting performance
- Asset values may be adjusted by agencies to increase consistency across regulatory regimes
- Liquidity - ability to meet anticipated/unanticipated obligations
- Higher liquidity avoids untimely asset sales
- Metrics: liquid assets ratio and operating cash flow ratios
- Reinsurance - mitigates risk and can improve financial stability
- Should be appropriate relative to risk appetite/exposures
- Agencies assess reliance on reinsurance to achieve business objectives

2. Operating performance/profitability

- Indicates future balance sheet strength and long-term financial stability
- Allows an insurer to meet obligations, generate internal capital, and access capital markets

## Page 40
- Strong, consistent performance ensures adequate risk-adjusted capital and strategic execution
- Key earnings drivers assessed by agencies:
- Investment performance
* Absolute and risk-adjusted performance
* Metrics: net yield on invested assets, total return, and net interest margin
- Underwriting performance - profitability before considering investment returns
* Underwriting profitability, sustainability, and volatility, business mix, and NB premium trends
* Diverse insurers tend to have greater stability, especially under adversity
* Analysis includes regulatory, financial reporting, and management forecasts
* Key metrics: ROA, revenue, capital, surplus/equity, Sharpe Ratio, and operating cash flow ratio
$\cdot$ P\&C: loss ratio, expense ratio, and combined ratio
- ILA: some metrics are not publicly disclosed

3. Business profile/franchise value - qualitative factor impacting current/future performance

- Influenced by market risk, competition, distribution, pricing capabilities
- Product characteristics associated with a strong risk profile:
- Minimal guaranteed risks
- Shared experience with policyholders
- Niche products
- Sustainable competitive advantages increase long-term financial strength
- Competitive analysis includes: product quality, risk, management quality, market share, and distribution diversity

4. ERM - signals predictability in cash flows and future performance

- Complex insurers should have robust ERM programs
- ERM components include: risk culture, governance, controls, risk identification, reporting, stress testing, and risk appetite
- Agencies assess an insurer's ability to identify, quantify, and manage risks, align risk with corporate objectives, and take necessary actions
- Weak frameworks can lead to financial distress; strong frameworks help maintain balance sheet strength and long-term performance

## Page 41
# 5. Capital structure/leverage 

- Capital type affects an insurer's FSR (debt, equity, hybrid, contingent)
- Debt obligations can strain cash flow in adverse scenarios
- Common equity is more flexible: dividends/retention are at management's discretion
- Rating agencies consider permanency, terms, subordination, and maturity schedule of capital
- Key metric: financial leverage ratio (compares debt to total available capital)
- Other leverage ratios: operating, asset, and liability


## 6. Legal/regulatory

- Considers economic, social, judicial, industry and institutional perspectives
- May also include macro risks (nation-wide or market-wide effects)


## Additional Factors

1. Ownership/financial controls - explicit or implicit support from parents/affiliates

- Changes in support or the parent/affiliate's financial situation are important
- Mutual insurers are evaluated differently than shareholder-owned insurers
- For sovereign parents, agencies analyze the government owner's creditworthiness


## 2. Group company considerations

- Approach varies: may analyze the group at the consolidated and/or individual entity level
- Considerations: the entity's contribution to group performance, strategic importance, support, and likelihood of future support within the group
- Lead entity typically has the strongest profile
- Also reviewed: impact of holding companies and non-insurance operations


## 3. Forecasting and stress testing

- Assessed as a part of risk management evaluation
- Ad hoc stress testing identifies vulnerabilities to specific risks
- Stress testing programs should be:
- Robust, comprehensive, and go beyond regulatory requirements
- Actionable and include contingency plans to mitigate stress scenarios

4. Environmental, social, and governance (ESG)

## Page 42
- All 4 agencies assess exposures to ESG factors
- Strategic and reputational risk: part of the balance sheet review
- Social risk factors (e.g. longevity trends): part of the legal/regulatory/operating environment assessment
- Governance risk review: part of the ownership/financial control evaluation
- Additional risks: carbon transition risk, changing customer preferences, and technology risks (cyber, etc.)


# Insurance Capital Model Methodology 

Each agency has its own quantitative tool for assessing an insurer's capital adequacy
The models vary based on the insurer's operational regime (US Stat, GAAP, IFRS)

- AM Best, Fitch, and S\&P have US-specific models
- Agencies take a global approach for non-US companies, considering local regulatory regimes and GAAP accounting

The quantitative results are a foundation for balance sheet assessment but don't directly determine ratings

- Consists of 2 main parts: required capital and available capital

Sensitivity analysis may supplement the results and varies depending on the insurer's circumstances

## AM Best Capital Model

Best's Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR) - measures required capital relative to available capital

$$

\end{aligned}
$$

Main focus: BCAR trends over time (stable is better)

## Net Required Capital Components

- Investment Risk (C1-Non-Equity and C1-Equity)
- Includes capital charges for both equity and FI securities
- Capital charges vary with asset class/rating
- Non-equity also includes reinsurance counterparty credit default risk
- Underwriting Risk (C2 Mortality / Morbidity)
- Mortality capital charges are based on excess claims relative to expectations

## Page 43
- Morbidity capital charges reflect pricing/reserving risk
- Interest rate risk (C3-Interest Rate and C3-VA Market)
- Relevant to fixed annuities and VAs
- Capital charges vary by product type and surrender protection
- Additional charges for A/L mismatches
- Business risk (C4)
- Business risk based on direct life/health premium, separate account assets, and other items
- Diversification (square root formula)
- Reflects independence of certain risks
- No diversification for business risk
- Confidence levels
- BCAR uses a VaR approach at various percentiles from 95th to 99.6th
- Prescribed risk charges vary by percentile
- Tail risk is assessed at the 99.8th percentile as a part of the wider ERM process

Available capital is usually based on US stat financial statements with various adjustments BCAR assessment ranges from "strongest" to "very weak"

| VaR Confidence Level (\%) | BCAR | BCAR Assessment |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 99.6 | $>25$ @ 99.6 | Strongest |
| 99.6 | $>10$ @ $99.6 \& \leq 25$ @ 99.6 | Very Strong |
| 99.5 | $>0$ @ $99.5 \& \leq 10$ @ 99.6 | Strong |
| 99.0 | $>0$ @ $99 \& \leq 0$ @ 99.5 | Adequate |
| 95.0 | $>0$ @ $95 \& \leq 0$ @ 99 | Weak |
| 95.0 | $\leq 0$ @ 95 | Very Weak |

# Fitch Ratings Capital Model 

Fitch calculates a factor-based Prism score at various stress levels ranging from "extremely strong" to "weak"

Prism Score $=$ most severe stress level where $\mathrm{AC}>\mathrm{TC}$

$$
\text { Prism Score }=\frac{\text { Available Capital }(\mathrm{AC})}{\text { Target Capital }(\mathrm{TC})}
$$

The Prism model uses factors that vary by product
For each product, TC consists of:

1. Product charges: static, non-company-specific risk factors based on the product's risks

## Page 44
- Capital charge $=$ stat reserve $\times$ risk charge

2. Diversification benefit: reduces TC to reflect risk independence

- Based on predefined, product-specific correlation matrices for each stress level
- Example: as mortality $\uparrow$, it hurts life insurance but helps payout annuities and nonlife products like disability, CI, and LTCI

3. Portfolio scaling adjustment: company-specific increase/reduction to TC based on an insurer's actual asset portfolio risk

- Based on differences in the insurer's asset portfolio vs. the one assumed in product risk factors

4. Operational risk: increases TC by $10 \%$ to account for OR
$\mathrm{AC}=$ cash-equivalent funds readily available under adverse conditions

- Based on US Stat surplus with various adjustments


# Moody's Capital Model 

Moody's publishes rating factor weighting guidance (unlike the other 3 agencies)

- Weights $=$ an approximation of their importance for rating decisions

To assess capital adequacy, Moody's uses various sources

- Regulatory models, outputs from insurers' capital models, and Moody's Capital Tool (MCT)


## MCT = Moody's proprietary stochastic simulation tool

- Estimates a distribution of changes in the insurer's net asset value (NAV) ${ }^{3}$ over many loss scenarios
- Provides 2 types of output from the change-in-NAV distribution:

1. Specific quantile of the distribution, compared with the insurer's economic level of AC
2. Relevant risk drivers at the chosen quantile by LOB before and after diversification

- Key risks included: interest rate, credit, credit rating migrations, defaults, mortality, lapse, reinsurance, and others
- Uses proprietary "proxy functions" to estimate changes in asset/liability values for each life insurance product ${ }^{4}$
- Not company-specific; designed to reflect average products sold in each market

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ NAV is an economic measure of surplus.
    ${ }^{4}$ Proxy functions are mathematical or statistical functions used to approximate other functions that are too difficult to compute directly.

## Page 45
- Asset risk: MCT simulates differences in the insurer's asset allocation and the typical allocation assumed for each product group


# S\&P Capital Model 

Normally based on GAAP financials if available; otherwise US statutory
S\&P uses a factor-based model to determine a level of capital above reserves to cover losses from disparate risks

S\&P uses 4 confidence levels (stress scenarios) to calibrate the prescribed risk factors for each individual risk using a 1-year VaR approach

| VaR Percentile | Stress Level | Associated Rating |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 97.2 | Moderate Stress | BBB |
| 99.4 | Substantial Stress | A |
| 99.7 | Severe Stress | AA |
| 99.9 | Extreme Stress | AAA |

S\&P's results are based on an insurer's total adjusted capital (TAC) compared with its riskbased capital requirement $(\mathrm{RBC})^{5}$

## RBC components:

- Asset-related risks: credit default, equity volatility risk, etc.
- Factor calibration is based on S\&P's market research
- Factors are applied to asset values
- Liability-related risks
- Non-life risks: underwriting, reserve, and premium risks
- Life risks: mortality, longevity, expense, lapse, and OR
- Factors are applied to exposure amounts
- ALM mismatch factors: ALM mismatch risk, systemic spread volatility risk, and guarantees/options
- Factors are applied to liabilities
- Additional capital charges specific to VA guarantees
- Diversification: based on predefined matrices


## TAC $=$ S\&P's measure of available capital

- Based on shareholder equity or policyholder surplus with adjustments

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{5}$ S\&P uses the same "RBC" acronym used for US RBC, but keep in mind S\&P uses its own formula. I.e. this is not exactly the same thing as the US RBC formula, but it's somewhat similar conceptually.

## Page 46
# Available Capital 

Each agency has a different version of AC, but each generally uses US stat surplus with adjustments for US insurers and GAAP/IFRS surplus for non-US insurers

Adjustments are usually post-tax and vary by life and P\&C

## Common AC adjustments include:

## - Equity/surplus adjustments

- Adjustments between BV and MV for assets not reported at MV
- Reserve adjustments
* Adjustments to reported reserves
- Partial removal of prudential margins
- Removal of equalization/catastrophe reserves
- Remove/add discounting of certain types of reserves
- Adjustments for the agency's view on reserve deficits/surpluses
* Add AVR back to stat capital and surplus
* Negative reserves may be non-admitted
* Adjustments for regimes that do not allow DAC in the accounting of unearned premiums
* Add back a portion of next year's dividends payable liability
- Remove goodwill and intangibles (e.g. VOBA)
* Why: not loss absorbing
* Significant intangible assets = lower quality
- Increase AC to reflect policyholder capital that is available to either:
* Support losses
* Accrue to shareholders
- Value of in-force (VIF)
* Increase AC to reflect VIF
* Should be based on a widely recognized approach and be independently reviewed
- E.g. PV inforce profit on an MCEV basis in excess of a local regulatory basis
* DAC may sometimes be used in lieu of VIF
- Haircuts to DAC in some situations

## Page 47
- Adjustments for investments in affiliates
- Debt adjustments ${ }^{6}$
- Hybrid securities (e.g. preferred stock, surplus notes, convertible securities)
* Have equity-like characteristics and are available to pay policyholder claims
* May receive credit up to a certain limit based on specific situation
- Non-traditional capital instruments (e.g. contingent capital facilities, ILS, LOCs)
* Off-balance sheet transactions that enhance financial flexibility
* Agencies analyze in detail and give credit on a case-by-case basis
- Other items for which adjustments are made ${ }^{7}$
- Off-balance sheet items (e.g. UCGLs, pension deficits/surpluses, and life VIF)
- Proposed shareholder dividends not reflected in financial statements
- Future expected operating losses
- IMR amortization
- Deferred tax assets
- FV of own debt
- Pensions and post-retirement benefits surpluses/deficits
- Specific circumstances identified by the rating analyst

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{6}$ Main idea: agencies may let insurers count a portion of these instruments toward AC (increase AC) depending on each situation.
    ${ }^{7}$ In general, the detail provided in the source reading is too limited/vague to expect you to know how these items affect AC directionally, and many of these items are very situation-specific.

# A Multi-Stakeholder Approach to Capital Adequacy 

Source Author: Robert A. Painter and Dan Isaac, Conning Research (2007)

## Overview of This Reading

This paper presents a unique approach to capital adequacy that considers objectives of all company stakeholders (policyholders, regulators, shareholders, and more)

Much of the paper is centered around an example involving a fictitious insurer, "Falcon"
The only way to understand the framework for the exam is to spend some time in the paper's example, and the video lesson covers it in depth with additional visuals

Given that this paper is a freely available published reference on the syllabus, I highly recommend having it while studying the detailed study manual and video lesson material

## Key topics for the exam include:

- Understand the different ways to measure capital adequacy
- Weaknesses of economic capital models
- Meaning of capital adequacy by stakeholder (6 total)
- Multi-objective approach to capital adequacy-overview and benefits
- Financial rating risk replication technique
- How to work with a rating transition matrix
- How to calculate capital available to release
- Considerations in setting a capital target


## Main Body

## Introduction

Stakeholders have different views of risk and how much capital is appropriate (policyholders, shareholders, management, rating agencies, and regulators)

Some stakeholders are more restrictive (e.g. regulators) than others (e.g. shareholders)
Economic capital approaches produce a single capital measure that may not represent how all stakeholders view risk

The authors propose a approach for flexible decision-making and capital management
The paper also introduces a Financial Rating Risk Replication technique to estimate capital adequacy

- Maps stochastic distributions of regulatory and rating agency capital measures to observable financial rating transition matrices

## Page 49
# Evolution of Traditional Capital Adequacy Measures 

## Regulatory and Rating Agency Measures (1990s)

- 1990s: RBC, S\&P's Capital Adequacy Ratio (S\&P CAR) and Best's CAR
- Pros: Formula-based, objective, and easy to calculate and compare
- Cons: Cannot account for all nuances of a company and doesn't account for all risks


## Economic Capital Measures

- More customized than formula-based measures
- Pros: Identifies all risks, calibrated based on the company's circumstances
- Weaknesses: Nontransferable between companies (very company-specific), not transparent to outside world, difficult to understand
- EC offers a more robust view of risk and embraces ERM
- Better captures interest rate and operational risk compared to RBC ${ }^{8}$
- Operational risk includes fraud, compliance failure, systems failure, competitive changes, loss of key personnel, etc.
- SOX is putting more emphasis on operational risks


## - Economic accounting basis

- Economic value is based on discounted cash flows
* Excludes arbitrary assumptions required by stat and GAAP
* Excludes items like DAC
- Construct economic balance sheet by projecting forward cash flows for each asset and liability, and then discounting using appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate
- Weakness:
* EC and economic value are not well defined compared to other accounting methods
* There are no consequences of failing an EC test (failing RBC, BCAR, etc. have real consequences)
- Timing: there are different views on what is appropriate for judging capital adequacy
- Narrow purpose $=$ liquidation basis (similar to US stat)

8 Table 1 in the reading on p. 6 indicates that interest rate risk is not included in RBC. This is either a typo or was perhaps making the point that the original C-3 component of RBC did not do a good job of capturing interest rate risk. Clearly, however, the RBC formula covered earlier in the online seminar does account for interest rate risk, and C-3 Phase II and beyond have only increased the interest rate risk component in US RBC.

## Page 50
- Straightforward: is the balance sheet sufficiently capitalized for current obligations?
- Broad purpose = support future growth (similar to US GAAP going concern concept)
* Less straightforward to define future operations and obligations
- Calibration end result of EC methods is a distribution of EC
- From the distribution, a capitalization threshold is selected (i.e. percentile level)
- Key questions: What threshold is appropriate? What does a 5 in 10,000 event look like?
- "We must remember dinosaurs are now extinct, and Rome lasted only 1,000 years"
- Risk measure: EC can use a variety of risk measures
- VaR is common (used in banking
- Tail Value at Risk (TVaR) is a more mathematical, coherent risk measure ${ }^{9}$


# Illustration of an Economic Capital Method 

Beginning on p. 10 of the reading, the authors show an example involving a fictitious insurer "Falcon." Given that this reading is a freely available published reference online, I highly recommend having it to review the graphs and charts while reading the notes below. The video lesson explains how to interpret these results using visuals.

Falcon has done an EC analysis and created a distribution of EC, from which VaR and TVaR can be calculated at various percentiles

Falcon has a $0.2 \%$ solvency risk threshold—meaning that they want to maintain enough EC to be solvent in $99.8 \%$ of scenarios (i.e. they EC to be positive in $99.8 \%$ of scenarios)

- At the $0.2 \%$ level, TVaR $=1.8$ billion of capital (average of EC values in the $0.2 \%$ tail $=1.8$ billion)


## Key interpretation:

- If Falcon releases 1.8 billion of capital today, they would end up with zero capital (go insolvent) in $0.2 \%$ of scenarios
- Therefore, if Falcon is comfortable with this insolvency threshold, they could release 1.8 billion of capital to use for other purposes (because technically they are holding more capital than necessary based on their solvency threshold)

In the paper's example, Falcon is using a solvency threshold, but the threshold could also be based on bankruptcy, default, or downgrade

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{9}$ TVAR is another term for CTE

## Page 51
# Weaknesses of Economic Capital Models 

1. Produces a single financial measure of required capital

- EC models only produce 1 view of the correct level of capital, based on a single view of risk and risk tolerance

2. No external consequences

- Only used internally to company
- No penalty for "failing" an EC test like there is for RBC

3. Inflexible in terms of time horizon

- Usually based on short time horizon
- Not designed to view the business on a going concern basis
- Ignores changing risk over time, and interaction of risks over time tolerance
- May need new model if change threshold

4. Risk thresholds are arbitrary and parameter risk in extreme tail is significant

- Sensitivity testing is critical
- Extreme tail of the EC distributions is highly skewed and uncertain


## Capital Adequacy Has Different Meanings for Different Stakeholders

1. Policyholders - want enough capital level to fully protect them in event of loss

- Less concerned with efficient use of capital or cost of over-capitalization

2. Regulators - primary concern is policyholder

- Also wants affordable rates and ability to pay claims
- RBC level = minimum capital level
- The more capital the better

3. Debtholders - want the company to maximize capital held to minimize the chance of default
4. Rating agencies - will assign higher rating the more capital the company has

- Also take a longer view than others

5. Shareholders and equity analysts - can have multiple objectives, but generally want to
(a) Maximize return on capital while holding enough to absorb unexpected nondiversifiable risk
(b) Have enough capital for growth

Higher capital vs. lower capital objectives

## Page 52
- Higher capital view: concern is unexpected shocks (more solvency focusedmore aligned with policyholder and debtholders)
- Lower capital: concern is inefficient use of capital and over-capitalization

6. Company management - has incentives (e.g. stock options) to satisfy shareholders' interests

- Generally want more capital than shareholders
- Management wants to keep company open, fully employed, and avoid rating downgrades
- Must be flexible and able to align appropriate level of capital with needs of primary stakeholders

Because different stakeholders are concerned with different things, capital adequacy shouldn't be a one-size-fits-all approach

# Multi-Objective Approach to Capital Adequacy 

In a subtle shift in terminology, the authors beginning referring to the "multi-stakeholder" approach in terms of a "multi-objective" approach here. The idea is to optimize over competing objectives, and there are multiple stakeholders within those objectives. The authors interchangeably refer to these "objectives" as "dimensions" below.

The multi-objective approach attempts to find a single capital adequacy target across 3 dimensions

## 1. Financial Variables

- Return on capital: shareholders care about efficient use of capital
- Rating agency standardized measures: companies want to maintain their ratings
- Mutual companies focus on BCAR
- Stock companies focus on S\&P CAR
- Regulatory measures: RBC and the probability of falling below authorized control level must be considered
- Economic capital measures: unique risks and capital needs of a company


## 2. Time Horizon

- Risks interact differently over time: risks correlate and diversify differently over various time horizons
- Stock risk evolves differently than bond risk, etc.
- Current capital supports future growth: treating operation as a going concern
- Not all growth is the same or require same amount of capital
- Capital is a "fair-weather friend": elusive when you need it most

## Page 53
- Company has to assess ability to raise capital in the future


# 3. Risk Threshold 

- 1-in-1000 events are unknowable: quantifying extreme tail event outcome and risk tolerances in an educated guess
- Failure to meet obligations versus "failure to thrive": failure to thrive risk threshold is potentially more constraining than insolvency threshold
- Death spiral: small downgrade in ratings does not impact policyholder, but can have large impact on company, leading to lower ratings
- Probability of a downgrade $>$ probability of insolvency


## Illustration of the Multi-Objective Approach

This entire example is covered in depth in the video lesson, which also ties in some of the intermediate steps covered in the appendix material. This framework is very difficult to comprehend from a verbal description alone, so be sure to check out the video lesson.

This illustration uses the "Financial Rating Risk Replication" Technique
Falcon has selected objectives:

1. Hold enough capital to avoid default
2. Avoid a one-notch downgrade ${ }^{10}$ by $S \& P$

Falcon wants to analyze its objectives over a 4-year planning horizon

## Financial Rating Risk Replication Technique

Falcon has mapped specific thresholds to company financial ratings

| Risk Threshold to Avoid | Risk Threshold Capital Quantity | Company Rating |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Default | $100 \%$ Authorized Control Level RBC | D or below |
| One-Notch Downgrade | $125 \%$ S\&P CAR | BBB or below |

In other words, Falcon has figured out both the capital threshold and the rating that will trigger the 2 events Falcon is trying to avoid: default and the one-notch downgrade

From here, Falcon calculates capital adequacy for the 2 financial variable/risk threshold positions for each of 4 years

- Results in 8 estimates of amount of capital needed

The authors then illustrate the steps for 1 of the 8 objectives: S\&P CAR one-notch downgrade in year 3

1. Step 1: Calculate a distribution of results for each financial variable, risk threshold, and time horizon combination
[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{10}$ A one-notch downgrade means being downgraded one letter rating (e.g. from A to BBB using the ratings in this paper).

## Page 54
- Figure 4 is distribution of year 3 S\&P CAR

2. Step 2: Calculate the probability of each of the distributions falling below the risk threshold quantity

- In the example, the probability of falling below $125 \%$ threshold in year $3<1 \%$
- The authors use a somewhat unconventional graphical technique in Figure 4 (p. 27) that makes it difficult to see what's going on, but this is basically the same information the authors show earlier in the paper with the EC threshold. It's just a capital distribution (in terms of S\&P CAR instead of EC). The video lesson contains additional visuals to clarify.

3. Step 3: Calculate the probability of the company rating transitioning from the current rating to a rating at or below the mapped company rating threshold

- Transition matrices are used to determine the probabilities (covered in more detail in Appendix A on p. 55 of the detailed study manual)
- Probability of downgrade from A to BBB or lower within 3 years $\approx 17 \%$

4. Step 4: Adjust capital such that the Prob(Step 2) $=$ Prob(Step 3)

- Interactively adjust amount of capital and rerun models until the probabilities line up
- In example, if Falcon decreases its capital by 0.973 billion, the probability that 3 year S\&P CAR goes below $125 \%$ is $17 \%$
- This aligns Falcon's downside transition risk with actual risk observed in larger economy


# Setting a Capital Target 

Repeat process above for 7 other combinations
Table 4 indicates the capital available (in billions) to release for all 8 "objectives"

|  | Time Horizon |  |  |  |
| :-- | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| Risk Threshold | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 |
| RBC Ratio (Default) | 1,393 | 585 | -35 | -354 |
| S\&P CAR (Downgrade) | 794 | 895 | 973 | 956 |

See Appendix C on p. 56 of the detailed study manual for more detail on how to calculate these values

## Key Interpretations

- Falcon seems over-capitalized in the short-term (years 1 and 2)
- However, the year 4 RBC result indicates that Falcon needs to raise 0.354 billion in capital today to avoid default in year 4
- Falcon must weigh these results with its ability to raise capital
- If all 8 objectives are given the same weight, the year 4 RBC result is the most constraining
- Often companies will NOT weight each result equally

## Page 55
* Early years are likely to be given more weight than later years
- If access to capital is limited, Falcon is more likely to take quicker action to raise capital (than wait)

The results above are very different than the EC solvency threshold results discussed earlier where Falcon determined it could immediately release 1.84 billion in capital based on a $0.2 \%$ solvency threshold

- The EC analysis, when done in isolate, would ignore the RBC indication to raise capital
- Shows the importance of viewing capital adequacy from multiple perspectives


# Benefits of the Proposed Approach (Revisited) 

1. Incorporates unique objectives of all stakeholders
2. Aligned with real world decision-making processes

- Company objectives are listed and ranked, risk and reward of each evaluated and quantified, and best decision is made based on available info

3. Produces multiple estimates of capital adequacy

- Develop capital needs for each objective

4. Goes beyond solvency analysis
5. Consistent evaluation of all measures
6. Multiple risk thresholds and sensitivity testing

- Not all stakeholders have same risk tolerances

7. Multi-year time horizon allows planning for future actions
8. Appropriately represents risk diversification and aggregation over time:

- Risk factors interact differently over time

9. Risk thresholds calibrated to observable information

## Areas for Further Research

The authors recommend 3 ways their research could be improved on

1. Management Intervention

- Currently do not model possible management intervention over time horizon
- Additional step would be to overlay dynamic feedback of management reactions to changes in the business

2. Multiyear transition matrices

- Current transition matrix is 1-year matrix

## Page 56
- May be more accurate to develop multi-year transition matrices

3. Rating standards shifts

- Rating agencies have been changing the definition of particular ratings
- This means a rating could shift even if nothing much changed at the company level


# Appendices 

## Appendix A: Transition Matrices

## Table A. 1 is a 1-year transition matrix

Each cell $=$ the probability in 1 year of moving from Rating $i$ to Rating $j$
Examples:

- $\operatorname{Prob}[$ Move from B to A$]=0.22 \%$
- $\operatorname{Prob}[$ Move from B to BB$]=6.21 \%$
- Probability of staying at $B=82.49 \%=\operatorname{Prob}[$ Move from $B$ to $B]$
- Probability of moving from A to BBB or below

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\operatorname{Prob}[\text { A to BBB }]+\operatorname{Prob}[\text { A to BB }]+\cdots+\operatorname{Prob}[\text { A to D }] \\
& =5.86 \%+0.43 \%+0.16 \%+0.03 \%+0.05 \%=6.53 \%
\end{aligned}
$$

Tables A.2, A.3, and A. 4 are the 2-year, 3-year, and 4-year transition matrices, respectively

- These are read exactly the same way as the 1-year table-the probabilities just represent multi-year periods

Examples:

- Probability of moving from B to A in 3 years $=0.65 \%$
- Probability of starting at Rating A and still having Rating A after 4 years $=71.88 \%$

Table A. 5 collects the transition probabilities associated with the 4-year multi-objective example discussed in the paper

|  |  | Time Horizon |  |  |  |
| :-- | :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Risk Threshold | Transition | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 |
| RBC (Default) | A to D | $0.05 \%$ | $0.14 \%$ | $0.26 \%$ | $0.43 \%$ |
| S\&P CAR (Downgrade) | A to BBB or lower | $6.53 \%$ | $12.26 \%$ | $17.32 \%$ | $21.79 \%$ |

The $17 \%$ probability for year 3 is the same $17 \%$ the example referred to

## Page 57
# Appendix B: Capital Adequacy Formulas and Ratings 

Appendix B contains formulas for the covariance-adjusted US RBC as well as formulas for S\&P 500 CAR and BCAR. The RBC formula in this appendix is also fairly out of date (if not just wrong), and I don't think it's likely to be tested.

S\&P and AM Best use their own formulas for capital adequacy. I don't think it's likely an exam question would require you to memorize these, but we've included them here for reference.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{BCAR} & =\frac{\text { Adj Surplus }}{\text { Net Required Capital }} \\
\text { Net Required Capital } & =\sqrt{B 1^{2}+B 2^{2}+B 3^{2}+(0.5 \times B 4)^{2}+(0.5 \times B 4+B 5)^{2}+B 6^{2}+B 7^{2}} \\
B 1 & =\text { fixed income securities } \\
B 2 & =\text { equity securities } \\
B 3 & =\text { interest rate } \\
B 4 & =\text { credit } \\
B 5 & =\text { loss reserves } \\
B 6 & =\text { net written premium } \\
B 7 & =\text { off balance sheet }
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\text { S\&P CAR }=\frac{\text { Total Adj Capital }- \text { Asset Risk Charges }- \text { Credit Risk Charges }}{\text { Underwriting Risk }+ \text { Reserve Risk }+ \text { Other Business Risk }}
$$

Total Adj Capital $=$ Stat Surplus $\pm$ Loss Reserve Deficiency + Time Value of Money
The remainder of Appendix B contains S\&P's specific definitions for all the rating categories (AAA through D). I recommend skimming over, but not memorizing or spending much time here.

## Appendix C: Falcon Illustrative Calculations

Table C. 1 shows the direct method of calculating the capital available for release for the RBC Default Measure

|  |  | Time Horizon |  |  |  |
| :-- | :-- | --: | --: | --: | --: |
|  |  | 1 year | 2 years | 3 years | 4 years |
|  | VaR Threshold Prob[A to D] | $0.05 \%$ | $0.14 \%$ | $0.26 \%$ | $0.43 \%$ |
| (1) | VaR of RBC | $248 \%$ | $164 \%$ | $96 \%$ | $55 \%$ |
| (2) | Target RBC = Authorized Control Level | $100 \%$ | $100 \%$ | $100 \%$ | $100 \%$ |
| $(3)=(1)-(2)$ | Difference | $148 \%$ | $64 \%$ | $-4 \%$ | $-45 \%$ |
| $(4)$ | ACL RBC (billions) | 982.9 | 999.6 | 984.8 | 938.4 |
| $(5)=(3) \times(4)$ | Capital Available for Release | $1,454.7$ | 639.8 | -39.4 | -422.3 |
| $(6)$ | Geometric Annual Return on Assets | $4.38 \%$ | $4.33 \%$ | $4.29 \%$ | $4.24 \%$ |
| $(8)=\frac{(5)}{[1+(6)]^{2}}$ | Current Capital Available for Release | $1,393.7$ | 587.8 | -34.7 | -357.7 |
|  | Results shown in paper | $1,392.6$ | 584.5 | -35.3 | -353.8 |
|  | Rounding difference (see note below) | -1.0 | -3.2 | -0.6 | 3.8 |

## Page 58
As explained in the body of the paper, the authors say that the initial capital should be iteratively re-adjusted until the probability of exceeding the selected risk threshold is equal to the transition probability

- Line (1) = transition probabilities discussed in Appendix A
- Line (3) = excess capital held as a \% of required capital (ACL RBC)
- Line (4) = ACL RBC in dollars
- Line (5) = Line (3) in dollars = capital available for release at a given future period of time
- Line (6) = annual effective earned rate on projected assets (given)
- Line (8) = PV of Line (5) = capital available for release in current dollars
- These are the values in Table 4 in the main body of the paper ( $p .53$ of the detailed study manual)
- The values don't exactly match the values shown in the actual paper because the paper does not provide enough precision in the Table C. 1 values to exactly reproduce the bottom line numbers they show. I've chosen to show the values above so that they are internally consistent in this table. The rounding issues in the paper have caused a lot of confusion with past students, so hopefully this helps clear it up. The Line (8) calculation in the table above is the correct way to do it for the exam.

Table C. 2 illustrates the calculation for the S\&P CAR downgrade measure

|  |  | Time Horizon |  |  |  |

The calculation is the same overall—there are just some extra intermediate steps to calculate the S\&P CAR. The rounding error compared to the paper's values is higher since there are more intermediate steps.

# Appendix D: Marriage of ERM and Dynamic Financial Analysis (DFA) 

The authors say that it is wrong to describe ERM as DFA + operational risk

## Page 59
ERM is process that evaluates the interactions of a full set of risks inherent in a business
DFA is a type of stochastic analysis that models the risks and rewards of an operation in terms of financial results

DFA models are used to quantify the financial implications of an ERM evaluation

# Appendix E: Tail Value at Risk (TVaR) Defined 

TVaR = average of events in tail (same thing as CTE, which is what it is called in most syllabus readings)

For example, if the risk tolerance is $1 \%, \mathrm{TVaR}=$ average of $1 \%$ worst values in the results distribution
$1 \%$ TVaR will be higher than $1 \% \mathrm{VaR}$, since VaR represents the single result at the 1st percentile (assuming the results are sorted worst to best)

TVaR is considered to be a coherent risk measure (while regular VaR is not)

## Appendix F: Model Specifications to Support a Multi-Objective Approach

Model should be multi-year, multi-factor, integrated ERM/DFA model that does the following:

1. Model all significant risks on both cash flow and accounted bases

- Includes operating risks
- Includes uncertainty of cash flows

2. Calculate all relevant financial measures that support capital adequacy analysis

- Need stochastic projections for all key financial measures

3. Produce multi-year projections that incorporate the changing diversification and correlation characteristics of key risks
4. Be flexible to allow various risk thresholds to be evaluation

- Need distributions of key risk variables
