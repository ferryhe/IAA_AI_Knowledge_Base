# **Al's Accelerating Capabilityâ€”Doubling Every 7 Months**


- METR's metric to measure AI capability: the length of tasks (in terms of human completion time) that AI systems can complete with a 50% success rate.
- AI capability for handling complex tasks is **doubling every 7 months**.
- Current frontier models handle tasks reliably **up to a few minutes**; soon this will extend to **hours or days**.
- Within this decade, AI agents could independently manage **week- or month-long projects**.

# Al agents are NOT...

|  Misconception | Clarification  |
| --- | --- |
|  Just another ChatGPT-style chatbot | ChatGPT answers one prompt at a time. Agents maintain goals, state, and can use
tools.  |
|  A single-task copilot | Copilots assist within a narrow tool (e.g., Excel, VS Code). Agents orchestrate tasks
across tools.  |
|  A magic black box | Agents need clear prompts, well-defined tools, and data access. They're not auto-
magical.  |
|  A fully autonomous employee | They assist, not replace. Critical thinking, oversight, and decisions still rest with
actuaries.  |
|  Secure or safe by default | Agents can misuse tools or make incorrect calls-governance and audit trails are
essential.  |

## Key Distinction:

ChatGPT $\approx$ a smart calculator Al Agent $=$ a self-directed analyst (that reasons, tools up, and reports back)

The LLM enables the agent to:

- Understand instructions
- Generate structured outputs (e.g., summaries, code, queries)
- Decide what action or tool to use next

# Tools - Giving Agents the Power to Act 

- Tools bridge the gap between language and action
- They turn intention into execution, making AI agents effective.
- Example: Marvin's Use of Tools
- Needed to display the premium rate table.
- Used the 'show_table' action and 'read_table' tool with argument 'Premium_rate_table'.
- Without the tool, the action couldn't be executed.
- Principles of Good Tool Design
- Clear Purpose: Does one thing well.
- Well-Defined Inputs/Outputs: Precise and predictable.
- Complements the LLM's Strengths

# Tools - Some Examples

|  Tool | Description  |
| --- | --- |
|  Document
Retrieval | Retrieves underwriting manuals, policy wordings, or pricing model documentation from internal repositories.  |
|  Data Loading | Accepts and parses input data files (CSV, Excel, Parquet) including policies, claims, exposures.  |
|  Data Analysis | Executes Python scripts for data prep, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis.  |
|  Chart Generation | Creates actuarial charts such as loss triangles, lapse curves, reserves vs. actuals, etc.  |
|  Report Writing | Generates memos or PowerPoint-style summaries with charts, tables, and commentary for stakeholders.  |
|  Web Search | Allows the agent to fetch the latest insurance regulations or professional standards from official websites.  |

# The Agent's Reasoning Cycle

|  Agent
Name | Thoughts | Actions | Observation  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Marvin | I need to look at the
premium rate table. | Take the show_table action and
call the tool read_table with
parameter premium_rate_table | That looks like the correct table, I
can show that back to the user now  |
|  Zoe | I need to look at the pricing
report and summarise it. | Take the document_retrieval
action, read the report and
summarise it. | I have summarised it. I can show that
to the user now.  |
|  Carol | I need to provide feedback
to Roger on each section of
the report | Take the provide_feedback
action, providing feedback as
per user provided feedback
guidelines | Tone is not appropriate for a
business report, I should provide
feedback to that affect.  |

### **EV vs. ICE Vehicle Repair Costs: A Summary of Recent Findings (2023-2025)**

Recent publicly available reports and articles offer a somewhat varied but evolving perspective on the comparative repair costs of Electric Vehicles (EVs) versus Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles. While some data suggests EVs are becoming more economical in the long run due to lower routine maintenance, other findings point to potentially higher costs for specific repairs and components.

A prevailing theme is that EVs may offer savings in day-to-day upkeep. A June 2024 article from 7Gen, referencing Consumer Reports, highlights that owners of fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles tend to pay significantly less for maintenance and repairs compared to their ICE-owning counterparts. This is largely attributed to the simpler mechanical design of EVs, which feature fewer moving parts, eliminating the need for oil changes and reducing wear on components like brake systems, thanks in part to regenerative braking. Ampcontrol's September 2024 EV vs. ICE comparison reinforces this, suggesting lower overall maintenance needs for electric vehicles.

However, when it comes to collision repairs or the replacement of specialized EV components, the picture becomes more complex. Data from Mitchell, a technology provider for the insurance and collision repair industries, cited in a March 2025 InsideEVs article, indicated that the average repair claim for an EV in the U.S. in 2024 was $6,236. While this was a 3% decrease from the previous year and comparable to newer ICE models ($6,127), it remained higher than the average for all ICE vehicles ($5,066). The report suggested this disparity is due to factors like the increased labor hours for managing high-voltage battery systems during repairs and a greater

# A refresher on the task at hand... 

It's 9am on a Monday morning, you are in desperate need of a coffee, but your boss has an urgent request...

## The Issue:

- Recent product and pricing adjustments are causing a surge in customer complaints.
- The CEO has asked to analyse the customer feedback, perform some modelling on pricing responses, and document it all in a written report in the next hour.


## Your Challenge:

- You're new to the company and the recent changes happened before your tenure.
- Your modelling expert is off sick, and your data analyst won't arrive until 10am.
- With only 60 minutes, you barely have time to read all the complaints, let alone analyse them, consider responses, and draft a report.
