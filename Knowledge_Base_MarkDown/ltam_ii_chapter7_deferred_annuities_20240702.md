## Learning Outcomes

The student will be able to:
Describe basic deferred annuity product features.
Describe basic product features of fixed annuities, fixed indexed annuities, and variable annuities including related guaranteed benefit riders.

Previously, LTAM Part I Chapter 4.3 described deferred annuities and associated product features and guarantees. Similar to Chapter 5.1, Chapter 7.1 reviews deferred annuities and adds more depth. Chapters 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4 cover fixed annuities, variable annuities (VAs), and fixed indexed annuities (FIAs) basics respectively. Recall, FIAs and VAs have a fixed account which has features similar to a stand-alone fixed annuity. Our focus is on product features and account value mechanics from the consumers' perspective.

Chapter 8 covers fixed annuity and FIA cash flow models. Chapter 9 covers VA cash flow models. Chapters 8-9 cover additional considerations such as embedded options specific to fixed annuities, FIAs, and VAs respectively.

### 7.1 Deferred Annuity Basics

Recall from LTAM Part I Chapter 4.3, annuities can be categorized as payout or income annuities vs. deferred annuities.

A payout annuity or income annuity is presently making payments or makes the first payment within the first year (or a period close to a year, such as 13 months) of purchase, whereas a deferred income annuity makes the first payment after one year. A deferred annuity is an insurance product with two phases: 1) a retirement savings vehicle for the accumulation of funds and 2) the payout of funds. The "deferred" part of the name is used since the first "income" payment is intended to be well in the future during retirement.

A deferred annuity's first phase is the accumulation phase (deferral phase), during which the customer makes a deposit(s), also called considerations or premiums, that accumulates in an account earning investment return. Mechanically, a deferred annuity during the accumulation phase is similar to a savings account, mutual fund, or defined contribution plan. Deferred annuities have an account value which is the amount of funds paid into the annuity by the owner, plus interest credited and/or investment results earned on the account, less any expense charges or fees for elective benefits. The rules, benefits, and investment options may differ significantly among deferred annuities offered by various financial entities. There may be ancillary benefits during the accumulation phase, such as access to funds via withdrawals, death benefits, living benefits, and disability benefits.

## Page 2
A deferred annuity's second phase is the payout or annuitization phase in which the account is converted to a payout annuity or amounts are withdrawn in a single lump sum or a series of withdrawals. Deferred annuities have guarantees regarding benefit payment amounts made during the payout phase. Some national governments provide tax preferences to deferred annuities to encourage accumulation of retirement savings. In the U.S., for example, the growth in the account from investment income is not taxed until withdrawn, which could be many years later. This is in contrast to mutual funds where the investment income is taxed each year. In jurisdictions with preferential tax treatment, deferred annuity tax-deferred growth is a differentiator and advantage compared to mutual funds.

# Annuitization and Guaranteed Purchase Rates

At the end of the accumulation phase, policyholders have the option to annuitize their accumulated funds to purchase an income annuity, for example, a life annuity or a 10-year certain and life annuity. Most deferred annuities are taken as a lump sum..

Deferred annuities often have guarantees regarding benefit payment amounts made during the payout phase. These are included contractually as guaranteed payout annuity option purchase rates. Guaranteed payment amounts correspond to underlying guaranteed mortality and interest rate assumptions. Guarantees are a critical aspect distinguishing deferred annuities as an insurance contract versus an investment contract.

Recall from Chapter 3 (or LTAM Part I Chapter 7), that annuity purchase rates, also called annuitization rates or settlement rates, are expressed as a factor equal to the PV(1). The monthly income $\$ X$ equals the contract amount used to purchase the income annuity divided by the annuity purchase factor: contract amount used for purchase $=\$ X \times \operatorname{PV}(1)$. Deferred annuity products provide guaranteed purchase rates, i.e., the purchase rate used will be no higher than the rates guaranteed in the contract (the lower the purchase rate the higher the monthly payment). The monthly income is based on the lower of the guaranteed purchase rates and current purchase rates.

Guaranteed rates have the potential to be lower depending on mortality, mortality improvement, and/or when interest rates are low. Guaranteed rates are typically based on conservative assumptions (lower mortality and interest rates). Guaranteed annuitization rates are a critical reason deferred annuities are classified as insurance contracts versus an investment contract for accounting treatment and taxation purposes

For example, at age 65 and 3 months, $\$ 100,000$ purchases a monthly benefit for life of 100,000 / $143.830=\$ 695.27$. See LTAM Part I Chapter 7 for calculations of payout annuity present values $\mathrm{PV}(1)$ and annuity purchase rates.

Most deferred annuities provide alternative payout forms such as a lump sum, N -year certain and life annuity, or a joint and N\%-survivor annuity. Monthly payment amounts can be determined such that no matter the form or commencement age, the payout annuity values are actuarially equivalent. Actuarially equivalent means the expected present value of the monthly payments for two payout annuities are equal given the actuarial assumptions, i.e., mortality and interest rate assumptions:
$\mathrm{PV}(\$ X /$ month for "default" form $)=\mathrm{PV}(\$ Y /$ month for alternative form $)$
It follows that,
$X \times \mathrm{PV}(\$ 1 /$ month for normal benefit form $)=Y \times \mathrm{PV}(\$ 1 /$ month for alternative form $)$
FIA greater upside but downside protection, floor is generally 0 while offering competitive rates

# 7.1.1 Deferred Annuity Categorization and Product Features 

The different deferred annuity products allow consumers to balance trade-offs between upside potential and downside risks to reflect financial objectives and risk tolerances regarding accumulation growth, income, and safety. Asset allocation mixes investments across asset classes from safest to most aggressive: cash or money market securities to fixed income securities such as government and corporate bonds to equities and other risky assets. Equity market returns have historically averaged much higher returns than bonds but also have greater volatility.

During the accumulation phase, consumers' investment strategies can range from a spectrum of conservative to aggressive by altering the allocation mix. A conservate portfolio might have a mix of $10 \% / 20 \% / 60 \%$ in cash/fixed income/equities whereas an aggressive portfolio might have a mix of $5 \% / 25 \% / 70 \%$. Figure 7.2 illustrates a range of risk-reward tradeoffs.

Figure 7.2 Market Returns

|  | Conservative | Moderate | Aggressive |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Average | $7.0 \%$ | $9.0 \%$ | $9.5 \%$ |
| Best | $20.0 \%$ | $25.0 \%$ | $30.0 \%$ |
| Worst | $-7.0 \%$ | $-15.0 \%$ | $-20.0 \%$ |

There are several characteristics that categorize deferred annuities, not all mutually exclusive.

# Fund Growth Mechanisms 

A primary characteristic is how the funds grow during the accumulation phase. When applicable, a deferred annuity's account balance is increased at an interest rate called the credited rate or the credited interest rate which is declared by the insurer. The rate is declared by the insurer in advance, usually at the beginning of each contract year. Similar to UL, we can classify deferred annuities according to the interest/investment crediting mechanism: fixed, variable, registered index linked, and indexed. Fund values are often calculated monthly (on monthiversaries) for fixed annuities and daily for variable annuities.

Figure 7.3 Deferred Annuity Product Categorization

## Annuities


Fixed annuities: Fixed annuity accounts work like savings accounts, money markets, or bank certificate of deposits (CDs). However insurers' credited interest rates are set for much longer time periods than savings accounts and do not change for contractually specified periods ranging from 1-10 years. A fixed deferred annuity credits a fixed interest rate for a specified period called the guarantee period. Multi-year guaranteed annuities (MYGAs) are fixed annuities that are self-named as they have a multi-year guarantee period. Typically, insurers offer consumers a choice of guarantee periods at purchase and at renewals at the end of a guarantee period. For example, for a given product the consumer might be able to choose at purchase between the following: $5 \%$ for 1-year; $5.65 \%$ for 3 -years; $5.8 \%$ for 5 -years; and $5.7 \%$ for 7 -years. At the end of a guarantee period, the consumer receives a renewal notice providing a choice of renewal guarantee periods and rates. Typically the automatic renewal default is either 1-year or renewing at the length of the previously chosen guarantee period. Access to funds is restricted and surrender charges can be assessed for early withdrawals.

For consumers, fixed annuities have the lowest risk and also the lowest expected returns. Insurers bear the investment risk that returns will not be sufficient. Assets supporting fixed annuities are primarily fixed income instruments such as corporate bonds and mortgages, asset backed securities but also include other investments such as real estate and alternative investments.

Variable annuities (VAs): Variable annuity accounts work like a suite of mutual funds just as with VUL - the owner allocates money within the account amongst the sub-accounts which act like funds and can transfer among sub-accounts (perhaps with some restrictions). VAs allow consumers to choose their investment strategy from conservative to aggressive by their
![Page 4 Image 1](ltam_ii_chapter7_deferred_annuities_20240702_assets/ltam_ii_chapter7_deferred_annuities_20240702_p04_img1.jpg)

## Page 5
allocation mix to the different sub-accounts. Unlike mutual funds, VAs can have features or riders that make one or more guarantees on product performance, such as fund amounts or benefit payments. VAs also include a fixed account. There may be restrictions on the frequency or amounts allowed to be transferred to/from the fixed account and the variable sub-accounts.

For consumers, variable annuities have the highest expected returns and the highest risk. Without guarantees, the policyholders bear the risk and earns or loses according to their investments. The inclusion of guarantees, i.e., GMxBs, significantly alters risk bearing. See Chapter 7.3 and 9 .

Fixed index annuities (FIA) or equity index annuities (EIA) mechanically work like a savings account or fixed annuity but accumulation rates are a formula based on market index returns such as the S\&P 500 Index or the Nikkei 225 Index. FIAs are not stock market investments and do not participate directly in stock markets. A percentage, called the "participation rate," of the equity index's gains is credited to the account. The index interest rate is the participation rate times the index's return, usually subject to a minimum guaranteed rate which can be $0 \%$, as well as caps.

For consumers, FIAs are low-to-moderate risk and provide moderate returns typically with no risk of loss as the market return is floored at 0 in the formula (or a small percentage such as 1$3 \%$ ). FIA greater upside than fixed annuities but downside protection as compared to VAs and mutual funds due to the $0 \%$ floor while offering competitive rates

Formulas for rates can be complicated involving floors, caps (the largest rate that would be credited), participation rates, different indexed formulas such the index at a point-in-time or an average over a time period. There are many variations and other details. A simple indexed formula example is:

Annual accumulation rate credited at anniversary $=\max (0 \%, 70 \% \times 1$-year index return)
In the above formula, the 1-year index return is the growth in the index between anniversary dates. The $70 \%$ is called the participation rate. The credited rate is floored at $0 \%$, thus the policyholder does not incur any losses from market downturns. For example, suppose a policy's S\&P 500 equity account has $\$ 10,000$ on an anniversary date. If the S\&P 500 is up $20 \%$ at the following anniversary date, the index interest rate is $70 \% \times 20 \%=14 \%$ and the index interest credited to the account is $\$ 10,000 \times 70 \% \times 20 \%=\$ 1,400$. If the index loses $10 \%$, the index interest is $\$ 0$.

# PONDER 

How do insurers provide participation in market returns yet guarantee no loss?

FIAs also include a fixed account. There may be restrictions on the frequency or amounts allowed to be transferred to/from the fixed account and the index account. See Chapter 7.4 and 8 .

## Page 6
Registered index linked annuities (RILA) are in the middle between an index annuity and a VA. Like an FIA, RILAs are also based on participating in index returns: however, the policyholder also shares in losses. RILA mechanics are similar to FIAs but the floor is negative, e.g., -10\%. Due to the possibility of losses, many jurisdictions require RILAs be registered as securities, hence the "registered" in the name. RILAs also include a fixed account and also may have transfer restrictions.

# Risk-Bearing 

The different deferred annuity products allow consumers to balance trade-offs between upside potential and downside risks to reflect financial objectives and risk tolerances regarding accumulation growth, income, and safety. Figure 7.4 illustrates a range of risk-reward tradeoffs. The FIA and RILA floors are $0 \%$ and $-10 \%$ respectively; the VA does not include guarantee GMxB riders and is pursuing a moderately aggressive strategy.

Figure 7.4 Example Deferred Annuity Returns

|  | Fixed | FIA | RILA | VA |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Average | $6.0 \%$ | $7.5 \%$ | $8.0 \%$ | $9.5 \%$ |
| Best | $6.0 \%$ | $18.0 \%$ | $21.0 \%$ | $30.0 \%$ |
| Worst | $6.0 \%$ | $0.0 \%$ | $-10.0 \%$ | $-20.0 \%$ |

## Premium Structure

A Single-Premium Deferred Annuity (SPDA) is purchased with a single premium (or by transfers from several sources occurring in a short time-frame). A Flexible-Premium Deferred Annuity (FPDA) allows ongoing deposits to be made over time. In the U.S., substantially all of an insurer's FPDA deposits are from the initial deposit as most policyholders do not utilize the flexible nature and only one deposit is made. Both SPDAs and FPDAs often have a minimum and maximum initial deposit, e.g., $\$ 25,000$ minimum and $\$ 1$ million maximum. FPDAs have much smaller minimums to encourage recurring deposits.

## Interest Rate Guarantees

Credited interest rates are guaranteed throughout the initial guarantee period and each renewal guarantee period. Typically, fixed annuities have a guaranteed minimum interest rate specified in the contract - the lowest rate the insurer can credit. Historically, the minimum guaranteed interest rate was often a constant rather than indexed, e.g., to a 1-year government treasury bond. A minimum guaranteed rate is required and/or specified in many jurisdictions. For example, in the U.S in 1986 set the minimum guaranteed rate to 3\%. In the early 2000s as market interest rates decreased, the required minimum was changed to be based on the 5-year Constant Maturity Treasury Rate less 125 basis points, but not more than 3\% nor less than 1\%. In December 2020, the 1\% floor was changed to be no less than $0.15 \%$. Insurers may offer a stronger guarantee, that is, contractual minimums that exceed regulatory requirements.

## Loads and Fees

## Page 7
Front-end loads are assessed at time of deposit. Some annuities have a front-end load assessed to the deposit such as $1 \%$ or $2 \%$. For example, on an annuity with a $\$ 100,000$ premium and a $2 \%$ fee, the account value would be charged a $\$ 2,000$ load and essentially start at $\$ 98,000=$ $\$ 100,000$ - $\$ 2,000$. Some annuities may charge an monthly or annual administration fee, e.g., $\$ 100$ per year. Typically deferred annuities do not have front-end loads or recurring fees as annuities compete with other accumulation products such as mutual funds and CDs. Back-end loads are assessed after initial deposit such as at time of withdrawal, for example, surrender charges. Back-end load products are the most prevalent. Some have no loads.

# Surrender Values and Charges 

As with UL, a surrender charge is a back-end load or amount charged upon surrendering a deferred annuity policy. Likewise, a deferred annuity policy's cash value or surrender value is the account value less the surrender charge applicable at that time. Annuities typically have a surrender charge that starts at about 3-10\% of the account value and declines over a 3-10 year period. This contrasts with UL surrender charges which are typically based on Face and not the account value. The annuity surrender charge percentage is applied to the account value at time of surrender and not to the initial premium(s). The surrender period is equal to the length of the initial guarantee period. Figure 7.5 illustrates sample surrender charges on a deferred annuity purchased with 2-year, 3-year, 5-year, and 7-year initial guarantee periods.

Figure 7.5 Sample Deferred Annuity Surrender Charge Schedules

| Contract Year | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | $8+$ |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 2-Year | $6 \%$ | $6 \%$ | $0 \%$ |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3-Year | $6 \%$ | $6 \%$ | $5 \%$ | $0 \%$ |  |  |  |  |
| 5-Year | $6 \%$ | $6 \%$ | $5 \%$ | $4 \%$ | $3 \%$ | $0 \%$ |  |  |
| 7-Year | $6 \%$ | $6 \%$ | $5 \%$ | $4 \%$ | $3 \%$ | $2 \%$ | $2 \%$ | $0 \%$ |

For FPDAs, surrender charges may be based on deposit year rather than policy year, i.e., the surrender charge schedule is applied to each premium and its corresponding fund value. The contract will specify whether withdrawals are FIFO (first-in, first-out), LIFO (last-in, last-out), or pro-rata (proportionate).

Some deferred annuities have free partial withdrawals which allows up to a specified amount to be withdrawn each contract year with triggering a surrender charge. The specified amount is typically a percentage, such as $10 \%$, of the account value on the prior policy anniversary. Instead of a fixed percentage, some annuities allow the interest amount to be withdrawn free of charge. The free partial is often not available during the first policy year. In subsequent policy years, the free partial may be restricted to only be exercised during the first policy month. Some annuities may allow unused free partial withdrawals to be rolled into future years. Upon full surrender, surrender charges reflect as if free partials were made. For example, for an annuity with a $10 \%$ free partial withdrawal, a $4 \%$ surrender charge would be applied to $90 \%$ (= $100 \%-10 \%$ ) of the account value:

## Page 8
Without a free partial withdrawal provision, the surrender charge is $4 \% \times \$ 100,000=\$ 4,000$ and the cash value paid is $\$ 96,000$. With a $10 \%$ free partial withdrawal, the surrender charge is $4 \% \times(100 \%-10 \%) \times \$ 100,000=\$ 3,600$ and the cash value paid is $\$ 96,400$. We can think of the full withdrawal as occurring in two simultaneous separate transactions. First, $10 \%$ or $\$ 10,000$ is withdrawn without charge, leaving $\$ 90,000$ in account value. Second, the $\$ 90,000$ is withdrawn and the $4 \%$ charge is assessed. There is a $4 \% \times \$ 90,000=\$ 3,600$ charge and the cash value paid

# Example 7.1 

A 7-year deferred annuity has the surrender charge schedule as in Figure 7.5. The contract is surrendered during contract year 4 when the surrender charge is $4 \%$. At the time of surrendering, the contract value is $\$ 100,000$. Without a free partial withdrawal provision, the surrender charge is $4 \% \times \$ 100,000=\$ 4,000$ and the cash value paid is $\$ 96,000$. With a $10 \%$ free partial withdrawal, the surrender charge is $4 \% \times(100 \%-10 \%) \times \$ 100,000=\$ 3,600$ and the cash value paid is $\$ 96,400$.

We can think of the full withdrawal as occurring in two simultaneous separate transactions. First, $10 \%$ or $\$ 10,000$ is withdrawn without charge, leaving $\$ 90,000$ in account value. Second, the $\$ 90,000$ is withdrawn and the $4 \%$ charge is assessed. There is a $4 \% \times \$ 90,000=\$ 3,600$ charge and the cash value paid is $\$ 86,400$. The total of the two transactions is a $\$ 3,600$ charge and $\$ 96,400$ cash value paid.

## End Example 7.1

Surrender charges are also typically waived upon death or annuitization. Some annuities allow consumers to add riders which may waive charges for certain events such as unemployment, disability, critical illness, or confinement to a nursing home. Some annuities offer policy loans.

Surrender charge percentages are often related to the commissions paid as a percent of premium paid to agents and brokers. We can informally think of commissions as being paid from the investment spread that the insurers earn over the interest rates credited to policies; for example, earning $5 \%$ on assets with a $3.2 \%$ credit rate results in a $1.8 \%$ spread. Over five years, a $5 \%$ commission equals $1 \%$ of interest rate spread. However, the insurer does not earn the investment spread and cover commissions paid if policies surrender early. This loss is offset by the surrender charge.

Deferred annuities contractually specify a minimum withdrawal value. In the U.S., laws specify minimum guaranteed contract withdrawal values. Loosely, the minimum is $87.5 \%$ of the initial premium, a $\$ 50$ annual contract fee and premium tax charges, all accumulated at the regulatory minimum guaranteed interest rate. Taking into account, minimum guaranteed rates, minimum cash surrender values place a maximum on the total front-end loads and back-end loads that may be assessed.

## Page 9
# Bonuses 

Some deferred annuities offer bonuses that increase the contract value, i.e., credit, typically as either a sales inducement or as an incentive to persist. A premium bonus, also called a frontend bonus or Day-1 bonus, adds an additional amount immediately during the first year, for example, $2 \%$ of the initial premium. An interest rate bonus, or enhanced interest bonus, increases the interest rate in the first contract year(s), for example, increases the initial guaranteed rate by 50 basis points for the first two years. A persistency bonus is a bonus to the account at end of a specified period such as 10 years. Bonuses incentivize the policyholder to persist, especially the closer they get to earning the bonus. A bonus could add $2 \%$ of the fund value on the 10th anniversary. A bonus could prospectively credit a higher interest rate, for example, 50 basis points higher starting in year 8 . Some older product design bonuses retroactively went back and credited a higher interest rate. Today, regulators do not like retroactive features.

## Tax Status

As mentioned previously, some national governments provide tax preferences to deferred annuities to encourage accumulation of retirement savings. In the U.S., for example, the growth in the account from investment income is not taxed until withdrawn, which could be many years later. The taxation of the principal, that is premium deposits is based on the deferred annuities' tax status classification as either qualified or non-qualified. Qualified annuities are funded with pre-tax dollars, often through employer-sponsored retirement plans like 401(k)s or IRAs. Contributions to these annuities grow tax-deferred, meaning taxes are only paid upon withdrawal, allowing for potentially greater growth over time. Non-qualified annuities are funded with after-tax dollars. Since taxes have already been paid on the contributions, taxes are only owed on the earnings portion at the time of withdrawal. This setup allows for tax-deferred growth of the investment without the need for immediate tax payments on contributions.

# End Example 7.2 

There are several features that fixed annuities may have.

- Bail-Out Provisions
- Market-Value Adjustments
- Two-Tiered Interest
- Death Benefits and Living Benefits


## Bail-Out Provisions

A bail-out provision waives the surrender charges if the credited interest rate at the renewal date is lower than the bail-out rate specified in the contract. Equivalently, surrender charges are waived if the renewal credit interest rate is decreased by more than a specified amount from the current credited rate. For example, suppose an annuity is purchased with a 6\% 3-year guarantee, a 7 -year surrender charge $z_{s}$ and a $1 \%$ bail-out provision. This means the bail-out

| Contract Year | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | $8+$ |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 7-Year | $6 \%$ | $6 \%$ | $5 \%$ | $4 \%$ | $3 \%$ | $2 \%$ | $2 \%$ | $0 \%$ |

rate at the renewal date is $5 \%=6 \%-1 \%$. Three years later, if the renewal rate offered is $4.5 \%$, the policyholder can surrender their annuity with the $4 \%$ surrender charge waived. However, if the reset rate is $5 \%$ or more, then the $4 \%$ surrender charge would apply. A bail-out provision protects policyholders from large decreases on annuities with long and/or high surrender charge rates. During decreasing interest rate environments, many insurers floor the renewal rate at the bail-out rate, that is, they offer the greater of the bail-out rate and renewal rate in absence of a bail-out provision.

## Market-Value Adjustments

Insurers invest most of the funds from fixed deferred annuities in bonds and commercial mortgages as well other assets including collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and asset-

## Page 11
backed securities (ABSs). Fixed income instruments decrease in market value when interest rates increase and increase when rates decrease. Disintermediation risk is the risk that policyholders surrender their contracts due to increasing rates, for example, their existing credited rate is lower than current market rates on new policies. To mitigate disintermediation risks (the need for the insurer to sell assets when values have decreased), some fixed annuities have market values adjustments (MVAs) which protect companies from the financial loss if they have to sell assets that have decreased in value from higher interest rates. Asset values are also impacted by other factors such as credit ratings and liquidity.

Market value adjustment (MVA) is a positive or negative adjustment to withdrawals made during a guarantee period as opposed to those made at the end of the guarantee period. MVAs are formulas specified in the contract typically based on comparing market interest rates at the time when the guarantee period began with market interest rates at the time of withdrawal. For fixed income instruments such as non-callable bonds, values and interest rates are inversely related. This is also the case for MVAs. If interest rates are lower than at the start of the current guarantee period, the policy's MVA will generally be positive and the adjustment increases the amount paid. Vice versa, if rates have increased, the MVA will generally be negative and the amount paid is decreased.

MVAs are applied after consideration of any free partial withdrawal provisions. An MVA reducing the withdrawal value is limited to any regulatory minimum guaranteed contract withdrawal values. Some MVAs are only applicable during the surrender charge period. Some MVAs apply to annuitizations made during a guarantee period, while some MVAs do not apply.

Some older product's MVA formulas only allowed MVA to have a negative impact (increase the surrender charge), and some also allow the MVA to be positive (reduce the charge). Due to regulations and litigation, products today have two-way MVAs allowing both positive and negative adjustments.

Figure 7.7 illustrates two of many possible MVA formulas.
Figure 7.7 Sample MVA Formulas
MVA \#1
MVA $=\{(1+$ Current Guaranteed Period Rate $) /$
(1 + Reference Rate + Spread) $\} \wedge($ Remaining Years in Guarantee Period)
MVA \#2
MVA $=$ Percentage Factor $\times$ (Reference Rate - Current Guaranteed Period Rate ) $\times$ (Remaining Years in Guarantee Period)

An MVA's reference rate could be the credited rate for new contracts or could be an external rate such as Moody's Corporate bonds.

We consider Example 7.2's annuity with an MVA.

## Page 12
# Example 7.2 Continued 

Consider Example 7.2's annuity. Suppose the MVA is:
MVA $=\{(1+$ Current Guaranteed Period Rate $) /(1+$ New Contract Rate $+0.25 \%)$
$\} \wedge$ (Remaining Years in Guarantee Period $\}$
Without an MVA, cash value paid is $\$ 96,400$. Suppose the 7 -year guarantee rate is $5 \%$ and the policy is surrendered in month 3 of contract year 4, meaning there are 3.75 years remaining in the surrender charge period. The MVA is applied after the $10 \%$ free withdrawal, i.e., to $\$ 90,000$.

If the rate offered on a 7 -year annuity is $6 \%$ at the time of the surrender then,
MVA $=\{(1.05) /(1.06+0.25 \%) \wedge 3.75=0.95659$
which applied to $\$ 90,000$ equals $\$ 86,093.20$, reducing the surrender amount by $\$ 3,906.80$. After the $\$ 3,600$ surrender charge, the cash paid out is $\$ 92,493.20$.

If the rate offered on a 7 -year annuity is $4 \%$ at the time of the surrender then,
MVA $=\{(1.05) /(1.04+0.25 \%) \wedge 3.75=1.02725$
which applied to $\$ 90,000$ equals $\$ 92,452.18$, increasing the surrender amount by $\$ 2,452.18$. After the $\$ 3,600$ surrender charge, the cash paid out is $\$ 98,852.18$.

## End Example 7.2 Continued

## Two-Tiered Interest

A two-tiered annuity accumulates a second fund value, called the upper tier, used as the basis to determine the amount used to purchase a payout annuity upon annuitization. For example the annuitization fund might credit a higher interest rate, e.g., $1.5 \%$ higher than the first fund, called the lower tier, used for cash values paid upon surrender. For example, consider a $\$ 100,0007$-year fixed annuity crediting $4 \%$ with the upper tier crediting $5 \%$. The contract value is the lower tier which equals $100,000 \times 1.04^{t}$. The amount used to purchase a payout annuity is the upper tier which equals $100,000 \times 1.05^{t}$

## Death Benefits and Living Benefits

Many fixed annuities have a simple death benefit during the accumulation phase equal to the contract value or fund value without deduction for surrender charges and/or not subject to MVAs. The annuitant is not always the policyowner. Some annuity contracts might pay out different amounts upon the annuitant's death (e.g., account value) than upon the policyowner's death (e.g., cash surrender value). More complicated death benefits such as GMDBs with roll-ups and/or ratchets are not common with fixed annuities.

## Page 13
Fixed annuities do not usually have living benefits, but see Chapter 7.3 for a description of living benefits associated with variable and fixed indexed annuities.

# 7.2.1 Spreads and Crediting Rate Strategies 

Similar to UL, spread is the difference between the net investment rate earned on invested assets the and credited rate: Spread = Net Investment Earned Rate - Credited Rate

Spread covers profit, expenses, costs of product features and benefits, and the cost of reserves, capital, and risks. A common pricing and product design approach determines a target spread reflecting assumptions and investment strategy that achieves performance, risk, and competitive objectives.

The initial and renewal guarantee period rates may be based on current market rates, on the insurer's fixed annuity portfolio rates, on sub-portfolio rates where the portfolio is notionally allocated based on calendar periods, and competitive considerations. Common crediting rate strategies during renewal periods are a new money rate basis, a portfolio rate basis, and a new money to portfolio sequence.

A new money rate basis bases the initial credited rate on the investment strategy's net investment yield available at the time new premiums are received. Sub-portfolios are formed by the assets purchased over a calendar period of sales such as issue months (or several months where market rates remain in a narrow range). Sub-portfolio invested and reinvested cashflows are tracked and used to set renewal rates. For example, suppose sub-portfolios are formed corresponding to quarterly sales. Consider 6-year MYGAs sold during the first quarter of 2026. The initial rates are based on current net investment yields available reflecting the insurer's investment strategy. As annuity policies reach the end of their 6-year guarantee period in 2032, renewal rates are based on the sub-portfolio's net investment yield less a target spread.

A portfolio rate basis credits interest based on the insurer's net investment yield overall fixed annuity portfolio. On a given day, all new contracts and renewing contracts are credited the same interest rate based on the portfolio's net investment yield less a target spread. This means customers that bought contracts in a higher rate environment subsidize those that bought in a lower rate environment. Portfolio rate tends to be more stable and less volatile compared to the new money rate, as it averages the returns over a broader base of investments over a longer time span. Portfolio rates can lag changes in market interest rates. In rising rate environments, portfolio rates may increase slower than new money rate and vice versa, in decreasing rate environments portfolio rates may decrease more slowly.

An insurer may offer initial credited rates on a new money basis as well as for renewal rates over a short time period such as 5-10 years. After this period, the sub-portfolio ceases and is absorbed into the overall portfolio, thus, becoming a portfolio rate basis in the long term.

## Page 14
# Spread Composition 

We can notionally attribute (or allocate) spread into components. We could split spread into components such as

- Acquisition expenses
- Asset Risk charges such as defaults, interest rate risk, investment expenses
- Losses on surrenders in excess of surrender charges
- Cost of required capital and reserve strain
- Trail commissions
- Profit
where components are converted to rates measured as PV(component) / PV(assets). For example, suppose the credited rate is $5 \%$, the net investment yield is $6.8 \%$, and the spread is $1.8 \%$ or 180 basis points.

### 7.3 Variable Annuity (VA) Basics

A variable annuity (VAs) is a deferred annuity contract where the account value is based on a portfolio of subaccounts like mutual funds. VAs with guarantees are an internationally popular retirement income product that enables investment in risky assets and provides minimum guaranteed life income.

VAs are called unit-linked products in countries including the Eurozone such as the U.K. and called segregated funds in Canada. Unit-linked describes any account-driven contract that is tied in some way to a portfolio of assets or indices. Jurisdictions vary as to precise and nuanced definitions in their regulatory treatments as well as their IFRS and U.S. statutory and GAAP accounting treatments. In many jurisdictions, deferred annuities including VAs receive favorable tax treatment such as a tax-deferred accumulation, i.e., investment income is not taxed during accumulation but upon payout.

There are several features that VAs may have.

# Fund Investment Options 

VAs offer a selection of 10-80+ investment funds options such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds, money market instruments. The owner allocates money within the account amongst funds and can transfer among subaccounts (perhaps with some restrictions). Available mutual funds can be from mutual fund companies such as Vanguard and Fidelity or proprietary funds managed by the insurer.

In the absence of minimum guaranteed returns and death benefits, all of the investment performance from that portfolio of assets is passed to the policyholder's account. The upside is potentially higher returns during the accumulation phase resulting in a larger accumulated value or payout income. The downside is the policyholder bears the investment risk and market risk. However, unlike mutual funds, VAs are a life insurance product that typically make one or more guarantees on investment performance.

VAs also offer a Fixed Account which guarantees credited interest rates for a specified period which are then renewed reflecting current portfolio rates and market conditions. Thus, the fixed account serves as a fixed annuity within a VA. Fixed income instruments decrease in market value when interest rates increase and increase when rates decrease. To mitigate disintermediation risks (the need for the insurer to sell assets when values have decreased), there may be some restrictions on transfer frequency and amounts to/from the fixed account to variable funds. Some VA products apply an MVA to the fixed account. MVAs may apply to transfers and withdrawals from fixed account to variable accounts.

Most or nearly all VAs allow the policyholder to have specified target allocations (reflecting an investment plan). For example, $70 \%$ stock and $30 \%$ bonds or more specific such as $10 \%$ Fund 1, $15 \%$ in Fund 2, etc. As market values change, the subaccounts change by different amounts. Portfolio rebalancing is the process of restoring a portfolio's asset allocations to specified targets. Some VA product designs utilize automatic transfer algorithms to move money between the risky market accounts and a money market as an internal hedging strategy.

VAs also offer dollar cost averaging (DCA) which spreads out the investment of the initial deposit and/or future premiums over time. For example, the deposit is allocated to a moneymarket cash account and at the beginning of each month, $20 \%$ is transferred according to the targeted investment allocations. Dollar cost averaging removes the attempt to time the market to buy at lower prices.

## Page 16
# Mortality and Expense Risk Charge Fees (M\&Es) 

A mortality and expense risk charge (M\&E) is a fee assessed to the account for unexpected events including mortality risk expressed as a percent of the account value. M\&Es also indirectly cover a portion of commission and selling costs. M\&Es range from 50-175 bps ( $0.50 \%$ to $1.75 \%$ ). Each GMxB rider will have associated fees also expressed in bps. M\&Es and rider fees are typically assessed at the end of the year.

VAs might also assess a per policy load such as $\$ 30$ that is often waived or $\$ 0$ when the contract value is above a specified amount such as $\$ 50,000$.

Example 7.3 illustrates a VA without any guarantees.

## Example 7.3

A VA was purchased with a $\$ 100,000$ deposit all of which is allocated to a large cap fund. The M\&E is 150 basis points. Figure 7.9 illustrates the account value calculations for two different scenarios. Scenario 1 and 2 are based on market returns from 2015-2024 and from 1999-2008 respectively.

## Fund Administration Fees

## Page 17
Mutual funds charge investment management fees which range from 5 bps to 150 bps assessed on the fund value to cover fund management expenses and provide a source of profit. Fees vary by fund manager and by fund. For example, an S\&P fund's fee might be 5 bps but a real estate fund's fee might be 150 bps or more. Investment returns for mutual funds and for VA subaccounts are net of investment management fees. Investment returns credited to the account are typically net of fund fees rather than a gross return and an explicit fee charged to the account.

Insurers often have agreements with mutual funds to share revenue from fund fees. Revenue sharing is an arrangement by which a mutual fund company responsible for providing investment services to the VA's underlying mutual fund makes payments to the insurer. The portion shared varies by fund. The revenue sharing fees are about 20-40 bps on average.

The American Academy of Actuaries' Report on Revenue Sharing describes the purpose as follows. Revenue sharing compensates the insurer for services provided by the insurer on behalf of the mutual fund. In their normal course of business, a mutual fund incurs expenses every time one of its shareholders requests a transfer in or out of the fund. The variable account established and administered by the insurer aggregates all policyholder purchases, redemptions, and transfer requests and submits one net purchase/redemption request to the underlying mutual fund each day. Thus, from the underlying mutual fund's standpoint, the variable account is a single shareholder. When the insurer's variable account aggregates transactions, the underlying mutual fund is relieved of incurring the expense of processing individual transactions. The expense is incurred by the insurance company.

# Types of Guarantees 

Initially, VAs offered a return of premium (ROP) death benefit. For example, suppose an owner makes a $\$ 100,000$ deposit to purchase a VA with a guarantee that upon death the beneficiary receives the greater of the account value and the deposit. The owner allocates all the money to a stock fund. Two years later the stock market declines, the account value is $\$ 70,000$, and the policyholder dies. Without a death benefit guarantee, the beneficiary receives the account value of $\$ 70,000$. With a ROP death benefit guarantee, the beneficiary receives the original $\$ 100,000$ deposit.

Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, U.S. insurers offered additional types of guarantees and a plethora of variations. Advances in technology and hedging techniques allow insurers to offer sophisticated guarantees.

Deferred annuities often provide additional guaranteed benefits such as guaranteed death benefits and guaranteed living benefits which provide protection in down markets. Guaranteed living benefits make guarantees pertaining to amounts paid upon death. Guaranteed living benefits make guarantees pertaining to the disbursement of funds and payment of income benefits. In the U.S., $80 \%$ of VA sales have a guaranteed living benefit. Many indexed annuities have guaranteed living benefits or are offered as riders.

There are four basic types of guarantees associated with VAs:

## Page 18
- Guaranteed minimum death benefit (GMDB);
- Guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit (GLWB) and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB);
- Guaranteed minimum income benefit (GMIB); and
- Guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit (GMAB);

Collectively VA guarantees are often referred to as GMxBs. The latter three are living benefits and are collectively referred to as VAGLBs (Variable Annuity Guaranteed Living Benefits). Since 2006, the SOA and LIMRA publish an annual Variable Annuity Guaranteed Living Benefit Utilization Study.

A guaranteed minimum death benefit (GMDB) provides a guarantee on the amount the beneficiary receives if the annuitant dies. For example, a guarantee that upon death the beneficiary receives the greater of the account value and the deposit accumulated at 6%. This means if the investment choices made by the annuitant earn less than 6% annually the insurer will make up the difference. Suppose after a VA purchase with a $100,000 deposit, the annuitant dies 5 years later. The beneficiary will receive the greater of the account value and $134,010 which is 100,000 × 1.06^{5}.

In some jurisdictions such as the U.S., the cumulative investment earnings can be taxable to the beneficiary. An associated death benefit guarantee pays a specified percent of the account value, earnings, or benefit base to pay taxes, for example, 35% of the account value. There are several variations and have names such as Enhanced Death Benefit or Earnings Enhanced Benefit (EEB).

A guaranteed minimum income benefit (GMIB) provides a guarantee on the annual income paid when the annuitant ends the accumulation phase and commences the payout phase with a payout annuity. GMIBs also have guaranteed base benefits. The GMIB guarantees the income will be the greater of the guaranteed base income used to purchase a payout annuity at conservative guaranteed purchase rates, and the income that would be available from purchasing a currently available payout annuity with the account value. GMIBs often have a waiting period such as 10 years before annuitization can be elected.

A guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit (GLWB) provides a guarantee on withdrawal amounts for the annuitant's lifetime even if the account value reaches zero. The withdrawal amount is typically stated as a specified percentage of the guaranteed benefit base and varies based on the when the first withdrawal occurs. GLWBs also have waiting periods. Percentages are lower when withdrawals start early incentivizing annuitants to wait. For example,

|  Election Age | Lifetime Withdrawal Percentage  |
| --- | --- |
|  59½- 64 | 4%  |
|  65-79 | 5%  |
|  80+ | 6%  |

## Page 19
Withdrawing more than a certain amount above the specified percent typically voids the guarantee.

A guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB) is similar except the guarantee is the cumulative withdrawal amount and not how long or lifetime. GMWBs were introduced to the market before GLWBs. However GLWBs have been the predominant living benefit in the market since being introduced in the early 2000s.

A guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit (GMAB) provides a guarantee on the account value at the end of specified period(s) of time. For example, a common GMAB provision is that after 10 years the account value will be at least $110 \%$ of the original deposit. If it is lower, the insurer adds money to the account. Often times upon expiration another guarantee is automatically made, e.g., in 10 more years at the end of the $20^{\text {th }}$ year where the guaranteed value is the account value at the time of re-election multiplied by the guaranteed accumulation factor. The length of the period and the growth rate guaranteed vary. In many contracts, the guarantee is voided if withdrawals are made. If the specified accumulation period is the contract maturity, the guarantee is called a guaranteed minimum maturity benefit (GMMB)

The guaranteed benefit base is a hypothetical number used to calculate the amount of the guaranteed payouts, e.g., the withdrawals during the withdrawal phase. The benefit base is distinct from the account value (i.e., value of underlying mutual fund assets) which the annuitant can access less any surrender charges (account value growth is after fees). There are many ways the base is specified. The guaranteed benefit can increase over time, for example, each year the guaranteed death benefit resets to the greater of 1) last year's benefit accumulated at a guaranteed rate such as $5 \%$ and 2) the current account value.

A roll-up is when basis is guaranteed to be no less than the interest accumulation of the premiums paid less withdrawals at specified interest rate called the roll-up rate such as $6 \%$. Some products have non-constant roll-up rates. For example, rates are indexed to 10-year treasury rates with a cap and floor (that is, there are maximum and minimum roll-up rates) and the rates are reset annually or quarterly.

A reset or a step-up provision is when the base is guaranteed to be not less than the account value on some previous anniversary. Initiating a reset may be automatic or discretionary at the policyholder's option at pre-defined reset dates, for example, every five year anniversary. For example, at a reset date, if the account value is larger, the base automatically or electively steps up to account value thus locking in the larger account value as the base.

A ratchet is when the guaranteed base recursively captures the high-mark at end of each specified period such as annual, quarterly, monthly, weekly, or daily.

Ratchet Guaranteed Base = max(account value, guaranteed base at prior date)
For a ratchet, the guaranteed benefits base automatically steps up to account value whenever the account value is larger, thus locking in the market's high points (per the annuitant's investments) at the ratchet-versaries.

## Page 20
Roll-ups, ratchets, and reset provisions often cease at higher attained ages, for example, the roll-up is applicable up to age 80 at which the benefit base no longer changes except to reflect withdrawals.

There are two variations that combine roll-up and ratchet provisions. In some of these products, a roll-up and ratchet combination takes the greater of the roll-up base and the ratchet base. A second variation for roll-up and ratchet combination recursively compares the current account value with the prior guaranteed base accumulated at the roll-up rate

Example 7.4 illustrates the differences in the provisions. The word rich is often used to describe and compare benefits. For example, higher roll-up rates and weekly or quarterly ratchet periods are richer benefits than lower roll-up rates and annual ratchets. A roll-up and ratchet combination is richer than a single roll-up or single ratchet.

# Example 7.4 

Consider a VA purchased on March 17, 2025 with a \$100,000 deposit. Figure 7.10 illustrates the guaranteed benefits base for a stand-alone roll-up, a stand-alone ratchet, a combined roll-up and ratchet benefit which takes the maximum of the two, and a combined roll-up and ratchet benefit which rolls-up the ratchet, i.e., takes the larger of the account value and the prior base accumulated at the roll-up rate. The roll-up rate is a constant $6 \%$ and both the roll-up and ratchet frequencies are annual.

## Withdrawals and Surrender Charges

Policyholders may surrender or with withdraw funds from their VAs. A surrender charge is an amount charged upon surrendering a deferred annuity policy or upon making withdrawals. A deferred annuity policy's cash value is the account value less the surrender charge applicable to the entire account at that time. Annuities typically have a surrender charge that starts at about $3-8 \%$ of the account value and declines by policy year over a 3-8 year period. Note the percentage is applied to the amount withdrawn or account value at time of surrender and not to the initial premium(s).

Sample Deferred Annuity Surrender Charge

| Policy Year | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Charge | $6 \%$ | $6 \%$ | $5 \%$ | $4 \%$ | $3 \%$ | $2 \%$ | $0 \%$ |

A free partial withdrawal provision allows the policyholder to withdraw funds each year up to a specified amount. In the U.S., a common deferred annuity provision is a free 10\% partial withdrawal, that is, up to $10 \%$ of the account value can be withdrawn each year without incurring a charge. Excess withdrawals are assessed the surrender charge. Sometimes there are policy year and/or age restrictions. For many VAGLB products, withdrawals or excess withdrawals may alter the guaranteed base and/or benefit amounts. Free partial policyholder behavior is challenging to model.

Withdrawals impact the guarantee bases. There are two types of withdrawal provisions during the accumulation phase. Dollar-for-dollar withdrawals reduce the base by $\$ 1$ for every $\$ 1$

## Page 22
withdrawn from the account value. Pro-rata withdrawals proportionally reduce the base by the same percentage that the withdrawal reduces the account value.

For example, consider a VA where the account value is $\$ 100,000$ and the base is $\$ 160,000$. Suppose $\$ 99,000$ is withdrawn and used to purchase a new VA. Under dollar-for-dollar, the base is reduced to $\$ 61,000$ and the annuitant has locked in a cheap death benefit or income benefit. Under pro-rata, the account value is reduced by $99 \%$, so the base is reduced by $99 \%$ to $\$ 1,600$. Dollar-for-dollar which was the initial product design in the 1990s and is quite risky for insurers. For example, this risk was exposed during the 2008 financial crisis. Pro-rata was introduced about 2000 and is the standard withdrawal provision in today's VAs.

# Expenses 

VA commissions are typically between 3-8\% of the initial deposit. Some annuity products pay a trail commission which is a percent of account value paid on contract anniversaries. If there is a trail, it is typically 25-50 bps. Maintenance expenses are express on a per policy basis and/or a percent (\%) of fund basis. For example, modeled maintenance expenses are $\$ 30$ per policy plus 5 bps of account value.

## VA Evolutionary Timeline

What follows is an approximate evolutionary VA product timeline in the U.S. Many other countries followed a similar sequence although details and timing vary. The global financial crisis affected nearly all VA writers internationally.

Long ago Deferred mutual fund, single managed products with only a few proprietary investment options, no guarantees

Early 90s 10 funds (advisor funds). Basic guarantees such as a ROP GMDB (return of premium upon death).

Late 90s Investment options become paramount - there is a race to 30 funds, to 50 funds, to 100 funds. Optional death benefits evolve: roll-ups and ratchets. Living benefits are introduced

2000-02 Living benefits become paramount. Investments not a differentiator.
2003-04 Non-annuitization income benefits introduced
2004-05 Lifetime withdrawal benefits are introduced
2005-08 Arms race: more guarantees, more optionality, richer benefits. Product innovations provide little differentiation due to fast followers - many insurers are able to offer similar product features within weeks (product specs which are publicly available must be filed well in advance of product launches)

## Page 23
There is more differentiation and a wider range of features and fees. Some insurers discontinue some riders or exit the VA business. GMxB fees are increased along with less rich benefit (i.e., lower benefits). Insurers de-risk or re-risk products. Transfer algorithm products with built-in delta hedging are introduced, for example, Target Volatility and Constant Proportional Portfolio Insurance products. Some VAs automatically apply funds to purchase puts inside the account.

2015- Products and riders continue to evolve; some insurers exit market; market share becomes more concentrated

# 7.4 Fixed Index Annuity (FIA) Basics 

A FIA consists of a fixed account similar to Chapter 7.2's fixed annuity and one or mored indexed accounts. Indexed fund values determine the interest credited using a formula based on the index and other components. The insurer designs interest-crediting methods that provide more upside potential than a fixed annuity and provide the product's downside protection by placing limits on that upside potential. The answer to Chapter 7.1's Ponder regarding how insurers offer market participation yet provides the $0 \%$ floor protection is that insurers invest in call options on the index.

We use Example 7.5 to illustrate FIA indexing components chosen for illustrative purposes. Following the example we provide definitions and describe variations on Example 7.5's components. The perspective is from the point of view of the consumer. Chapter 8 provides more examples and illustrates FIA cash flow models from both the consumer and insurer's perspective as well as discussing issues related to managing and modeling FIAs.

## Example 7.5

A FIA was purchased March 17, 2025 with $\$ 100,000$ and the XYZ Index was 4,000 at that time. Index credits are credited on each anniversary equal to a percentage of the annual growth in the Index, but are never negative. The percentages, called participation rates, are declared each anniversary in advance and apply to the following policy year. Figure 7.11 illustrates the FIA's components and Index Account value calculations.

Cells A4..B7 and Columns A-B and D are inputs. Column A is the policy's anniversary dates and Column B is the XYZ Index's value on those dates. Column D is the declared Participation Rate for the policy year. Cells B5 (floor) and B6 (cap) are the minimum and maximum rates respectively that will be credited to the account. Cell B7 is a spread that is deducted from the growth in the Index prior to applying the participation rate. In Chapter 8, we will see how an insurer determines participation rates.

Column E calculates the growth in the Index. We do not use the word return because any dividends paid are not included.

$$
E 5=D 5 / D 4-1, \text { etc. }
$$

Column G calculates the credited rate applying the spread, participation rate, floor and cap.

$$
G 5=M I N(B \$ 6, \operatorname{MAX}(0,\left((E 5-B \$ 7)^{*} F 5\right))), \text { etc. }
$$

Column H calculates the EOP Index Account's value which equals the prior EOP value plus Column G's Index Credits which is the growth in the account.

$$
H 5=H 4+I 5, \text { etc. }
$$

Column I calculates the Index Credits as the credited rate multiplied by the prior EOP account value, i.e., BOP Account value.

$$

$$

For comparison purposes, Column J calculates the account value using the full Index's growth rate ignoring the floor and cap, that is, a full market participant (ignoring dividends paid).

# End Example 7.5 

FIA components include the index, index term, participation rate, cap, floor, spread, index method, index credits, and guaranteed value.

## Page 25
The Index is the market index used to calculate the interest credited to the account. Popular market indices include the S\&P 500, NASDAQ-100, MSCI EAFE (covers equities from developed markets outside of North America, including Europe, Australasia, and the Far East), DJIA (Dow Jones Industrial Average), Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index. In recent years, custom or proprietary indices are being offered to customize volatility control, momentum, and asset allocation techniques to manage risk and optimize returns.

The term or index term or index period is the period over which the index-linked interest is calculated and credited to the annuity, i.e., the crediting frequency. Terms typically range from 1-10 years with one year being the most common and popular. FIAs can have single or multiple consecutive terms, with a window at the end of each term allowing penalty-free withdrawals.

Participation rate determines the proportion of the index's increase used to calculate the interest during the index term. Insurers may frequently adjust the initial participation rate for new annuities. Participation rates are usually guaranteed for a specified period. Subsequently, the insurer sets a new participation rate for the next period. Some FIAs specify a minimum and/or a maximum participation rate.

A cap is the maximum interest rate that will be credited. Not all FIAs have caps. A cap lower's the insurers costs which is used fund higher participation rates or offer different index terms or product features such as free partial withdrawals. Unlike Example 7.5, to limit the market return credited to the account, FIAs typically either use a participation rate or cap and only infrequently have both. Some FIAs specify a minimum cap.

A floor is the minimum interest rate that will be credited. Floors are typically $0 \%$ which is what we use in this book. This ensures that even if the index decreases, the credited interest will not be negative. All FIAs have floors which serves as a guaranteed minimum interest rate.

A spread or margin is a fixed percentage that is deducted from the growth in the index either before or after applying the participation rate or before or after applying the cap. Example 7.5 deducted the spread before applying the participation rate and before applying the cap. Some FIAs specify a maximum spread that will be assessed.

# Indexing Methods 

Indexing method or crediting method specifies how changes in the index are measured to calculate interest during the index period. These methods determine what is used to measure the growth rate $=$ end value $/$ begin value -1 by specifying the beginning (denominator) and ending (numerator) values. Common methods include point-to-point, ratchets, averaging, highwater mark, low-water-mark, binary, and monthly caps. These methods are described below, although there are variations as well as other exotic methods in the FIA market.

A point-to-point or European method is based on the difference between the index value at two dates or "points" - the first and last days of the index term, i.e., growth rate = EOP value / BOP value -1 . The index's values at other dates during are not used, thus, similar to European

## Page 26
option payoff. Interest is credited at the end of the term. An Annual Point-to-Point uses a oneyear index term. A Multi-Year Point-to-Point uses a multi-year index term such as 2-10 years.

A ratchet applies the point-to-point outcomes to subperiods within the index term. For example, a 10-year point-to-point FIA with an annual ratchet applies the floor and locks in any growth in the account at each anniversary, i.e., a series of ten annual point-to-point interest credits. A 10-year point-to-point FIA without an annual ratchet only uses the 10-year period's beginning and ending index values.

An averaging or Asian method is based on the index term's starting index value and the index's average value at the end of multiple consecutive sub-periods during the index term, i.e., growth rate = Average value / BOP value - 1. Monthly averaging and daily averaging average the 12 month-end and daily day-end index values respectively during the one-year index term. Averaging is usually less expensive than point-to-point methods since averaging reduces volatility by allowing gains and losses during the index term to offset each other. Daily averaging reduces volatility more than monthly averaging which reduces volatility more than point-to-point (which we can be viewed as annual averaging). Annual month averaging typically have higher caps than annual point-to-point caps.

A high-water mark method is based on the index term's starting index value and, looking back at the end of the term, the index's highest value at the end of multiple consecutive subperiods during the index term, i.e., growth rate = Highest subperiod-end value / BOP value - 1. A monthly high-water mark with an annual lookback uses the highest month-end value reached during a one-year index term compared to the BOP value, growth rate = Highest month-end value / BOP value - 1. A daily high-water mark method is similar but uses the highest

A low-water mark method is based on the index term's ending index value and, looking back at the end of the term, the index's lowest value at the end of multiple consecutive subperiods during the index term, i.e., growth rate = EOP value / Lowest subperiod-end value - 1. A monthly low-water mark with an annual lookback uses the lowest month-end value reached during a one-year index term compared to the EOP value, growth rate = EOP value / Lowest month-end value -1 .

A binary or performance-triggered method credits a declared fixed interest rate if the index growth's at the end of the term equals or exceeds a rate called the trigger rate, otherwise $0 \%$ is credited. The trigger rate is often $0 \%$. For example, suppose the declared fixed rate is $5 \%$ and the trigger rate is $0 \%$. If the index grows during the year then the credited rate is $5 \%$ and if the index return is negative then zero is credited to the account. The credited interest is a "binary" all or nothing outcome.

A monthly cap method credits the sum of each month's capped growth rate during a 1-year index term if it is positive and credits $0 \%$ if the sum is negative.

Example 7.6 illustrates each of the methods.

## Page 27
# Example 7.6 

Consider FIA products with a 100\% participation rate and a 0\% floor. The monthly cap FIA uses a $4 \%$ monthly cap and binary FIA's declared fixed rate is $4.5 \%$. Figure 7.12 presents month-end index values and associated calculations.

Row 4 calculates the monthly growth rate: $\mathrm{C} 4=\mathrm{C} 3 / \mathrm{B} 3-1$. Row 5 applies a $4 \%$ cap to each month's rate: $\mathrm{C} 5=\mathrm{MIN}(0.04, \mathrm{C} 4)$. B6 calculates the average of the 12 monthly index values: B6 = AVERAGE(C3:N3). B7 and B8 calculate the max and min of the 12 monthly index values: B7 = MAX(C3:N3) and B8 = MIN(C3:N3).
a) An annual point-to-point FIA credited rate equals N3/B3-1=215/200-1=7.5\%
b) A monthly averaging FIA credited rate equals B6/B3-1=213.3/200-1=6.7\%
c) A high-water mark FIA credited rate equals B7/B3-1=245/200-1=22.5\%
d) A low-water mark FIA credited rate equals N3/B8-1=215/180-1=19.4\%
e) A binary FIA credited rate equals $4.5 \%$ since the $7.5 \%$ annual growth is positive.
f) A monthly cap FIA credited rate is $0 \%$ since the sum of capped months, $-2.7 \%$, is negative.

## End Example 7.6

The reader should not draw any general conclusions from Example 7.6 regarding the superiority of returns provided by one index method over another. One method does not always outperform another method - each performs better or worse depending on market results.

Annual point-to-point cap methods (with 100\% participation) and trigger methods typically perform better when annual index returns are relatively stable. Participation rate methods (without caps) typically perform better than other methods when index returns are high. However, with lower index returns, an annual point-to-point with 100\% participation rate may perform better. Annual month averaging methods perform better with higher volatility indices or with large index decreases at the end of policy years. Monthly cap sum methods perform better when the index has moderately stable growth throughout the policy year and few large negative monthly returns.

# Guaranteed Minimum Values 

Some jurisdictions require a guaranteed minimum value. For example, in the U.S. the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Individual Deferred Annuities requires a minimum accumulated value equal to $87.5 \%$ of premiums paid less any partial withdrawals, accumulated at the nonforfeiture minimum interest rate.

## Types of Guarantees

FIAs also offer GMDBs and living benefits such as GLWBs. See Chapter 7.3 for descriptions of GMxBs.

## FIA Evolutionary Timeline

What follows is an approximate evolutionary FIA product timeline in the U.S. Many other countries followed a similar sequence although details and timing vary.

Mid 90s Plain vanilla FIAs are introduced
Late 90s Few players enter the FIA market; FIAs do not receive respect in the market high commissions and surrender charges - sales nearly all agent sold

Circa 2000 About 40 carriers offering about 150 FIA products; S\&P 500 nearly the only index offered

2000-10 Steady decline in average commission rates more indices offered, and proliferating complexity of crediting methods and caps; concentrated market share continues; challenges include over-the-counter equity options market, option costs, counter party credit risk

2008-13 Riders, including living benefits, are introduced.
2010-12 Post financial crisis, over 30 insurers enter the FIA market; Chicago Board of Exchange (CBOE) gets in the game - exchange traded FLEX Options: cost savings, centralized clearing, daily independent pricing, liquidity; expanded distribution by broker/dealers, proprietary products

2008-13 Riders, including living benefits, are introduced
2013- More companies, more riders, more sales, more complexity; more private equity firms enter FIA (and MYGA) markets
