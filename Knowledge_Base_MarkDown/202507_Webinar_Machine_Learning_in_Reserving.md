# About the IFoA Machine Learning in Reserving Working Party 

- Volunteers from around the world
- Help actuaries gain Machine Learning ("ML") skills with Foundations page \& resources
- Providing code and explanations - "try this at home"
- Neural Network ("NN") framework - making NNs accessible.

We want companies to take and apply to their own data and feedback findings

# Why Machine Learning in Claims Reserving? 

- Use all of the data: potential to be more accurate in a big data world? If results show it is a more predictive model, is that a case to use it?
- Granular predictions: level of detail to support actionable insights e.g.
- Pricing - better estimate of claims when drilling down into segments
- Claims analytics - support fraud modelling and cost containment efforts
- Diagnostics exist for "black box" models: SHAP, LIME, PDP
- Can act as early warning system - detecting changes in trend

# Potential for Neural Networks 

Within the working party, we are exploring Neural Networks heavily. Here's why:

## Advantages:

- Residual networks generalize GLMs
- Used in state-of-the-art models for e.g. image, text, audio transcriptions
- Transformers quite powerful for sequence data generally
- Entity embeddings can effectively model categorical variables
- Output probability distributions with mixture density


## Issues to consider:

- In time series, simpler models often perform as well as neural networks ("Are Transformers Effective for Time Series Forecasting?" A. Zeng et al)
- With tabular-only data, gradient boosted decision trees are often easy to calibrate to a good result.
- Random initialization may lead to variance in model predictions
- Complexity vs simpler models

"It is difficult to find time and resources to develop these skills..."

# Learning Python (Quickly) 

## Basic Python and Data Wrangling

Download Visual Studio Code, a free code editor by Microsoft and follow steps in their YouTube tutorial for "VSCode Jupyter". Follow Chapters 1-11 in "Automate the Boring Stuff" is a free-to-read resource on Python.
Read my (largely Al generated) gist on List Comprehensions and if familiar with SQL, a translation from SQL to pandas logic.

## Use Al to help

Claude by Anthropic and Google Gemini in Google AI Studio are excellent at coding. Be specific and define the format of your input data. Ask the LLM to generate test data and tests and diagnostics on outputs.

Potential: Ability to automate processes and free up time

# Developing ML skills 

I (and volunteers from the YDAWG and DSAIPC) have a cookbook:
https://actuariesinstitute.github.io/cookbook/docs/index.html
Vikram's intro: https://institute-and-faculty-of-actuaries.github.io/mlr-blog/post/foundations/2025-02python/
Relevant sections:

- Regression, Classification and Technical Price
- Workflow Management


## Exercises:

With help from AI, read the cookbook sections and build a Streamlit App to do a full Exploratory Data Analysis and a regression model on this dataset used in the SHAP article.

# Getting started with MLRWP 

## We have a blog:

https://institute-and-faculty-of-actuaries.github.io/mlr-blog/

- Learning resources for beginners with Foundations page
- Latest research for experienced practitioners
- Providing code and explanations: designed for you to able to download and use on your own data.

And a book!

Mostly in R

## Page 13
# Simulated data - SPLICE 

- Problem: There is a lack of real-world datasets to test and benchmark new machine learning reserving techniques.
- Solution: The SPLICE paper presents a framework and a free R package to generate realistic, synthetic claims data.
- Key Advantage: The synthetic data allows researchers to introduce specific challenges to test how well models respond. Benchmark different models in specific claim scenarios.
- Technical Innovation: SPLICE extends a previous package by adding customisable simulations of case estimates, based on realistic actuarial principles.

# Tabular based models: *Triangles are tables and chain ladder is a GLM*

#### **There is a GLM form of chain ladder:**

- Log link, over-dispersed Poisson
- *Incremental Payments ~ Occurrence Period + Development Period*
- Occurrence Period and Development Period are one-hot encoded (1-0 flags for occurrence and development period = n, n=1...N)
- See https://institute-and-faculty-of-actuaries.github.io/mlr-blog/post/foundations/python-glms/

# Tabular data format

- Tabular approaches - convert the claims data to a tabular format
- Simplest example (right):
- X: Accident, Development and Calendar Periods
- y: Payment in the Acc/Dev period.
- Example table right is an aggregated dataset but can also expand to individual claim or policy dataset.

|  Accident
Period | Dev.
Period | Cal. Period | Claims
Paid  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  1 | 1 | 1 | $\$ x x$  |
|  1 | 2 | 2 | $\$ x x$  |
|  1 | 3 | 3 | $\$ x x$  |
|  1 | 4 | 4 | $\$ x x$  |
|  2 | 1 | 2 | $\$ x x$  |
|  2 | 2 | 3 | $\$ x x$  |
|  2 | 3 | 4 | $\$ x x$  |
|  2 | 4 | 5 | $\$ x x$  |
|  $\ldots$ | $\ldots$ | $\ldots$ |   |

# Tabular based models 

## Other regression models can replace GLMs

- Basic GBM, Neural Networks ("NN") or LASSO GLM on triangle data: https://institute-and-faculty-of-actuaries.github.io/mlr-blog/post/foundations/scikitexample/
- How GLMs are a special case of NN: https://owars.info/mario/2020 Wuthrich.pdf
- Example starting from a chain ladder and showing steps to get to a individual, probabilistic neural network model: https://institute-and-faculty-of-actuaries.github.io/mlr-blog/post/research/chain ladder to individual mdn/
- More advanced triangle methods than Chain Ladder? Could have NN analogues: "Penalising Unexplainability in Neural Networks for Predicting Payments per Claim Incurred" (Poon 2019) on individual policy, claim count and claim amount data

# Sequence based models

- Claims histories are also sequences:


- Sequence based models such as GRU, LSTM, Transformers may be relevant
- Current area of focus

# Calibrating and diagnostics

## The blogs

- **Explainer**: Takes code to implement a neural network and steps you through / explains what it is doing.
- **Diagnostics**: Provides examples of outputs you can use to understand what the model is doing and assess its effectiveness. Gives details of some of the different tools you can use to produce them, and steps you through how to create them. We intend to add to the Diagnostics blog over time.


- **Hyperparameters**: Takes individual hyperparameters, shows what happens when you vary them and steps you through how to change them in the code so you can have a go yourself.

# Generative AI and NLP

- Claims diaries often include unstructured data. But this does not prevent us from data miningâ€?
- Traditional approach is to have freeform text to be converted to model features with bag of words, embeddings:

https://actuariesinstitute.github.io/cookbook/docs/DAA_M07_CS1.html

- Can be applied to identify keywords that drive claims cost
- Not the main focus of the MLR WP but can add more predictive features in the application.

Large language models can also "read" freeform text (such as claim diaries) and create structured features based on the text. Cookbook example â€?reading freeform text from reviews: https://actuariesinstitute.github.io/cookbook/docs/py_llm_text_sentiment.html

# Example: Mix Effects 

## Scenario:

- The portfolio mix has shifted significantly in recent years across a number of dimensions (e.g. age, product tier, region). To complicate matters further, your product team advise that different covers \& demographics are likely to have claims that develop at different rates.
- Questions have been raised whether the mix change is triggering adverse selection and affecting how the portfolio develops


## Potential angles of exploration:

- Use pricing/risk factors as dimension into granular claim model
- Copy and extend pricing model to capture reserving effects (e.g. dev period 1 claims as predictor for ultimate)

## Page 24
# Example: Processing speed issue 

## Scenario:

- Paid is unusually high but faster processing may be a contributor
- Not enough history to see this in triangles, but other corroborating operational data metrics


## Potential angles of exploration:

- Rely on forecast? (which may or may not have ML elements)
- Build model predicting costs based on operational processing metrics

## Page 25
# Example: Case Estimation 

## Scenario:

- Case reserves are important for the portfolio due to large claims contributing a high proportion of costs.
- However, although there are detailed case notes, the case reserves set by claims team are inexplicably (or explicably) unreliable.


## Potential angles of exploration:

- Use LLMs to create structured fields from case notes.
- Build a granular model to create own case estimate model.
- Explore further drivers for variances with claims team, or use own case estimate for incurred calculation.
