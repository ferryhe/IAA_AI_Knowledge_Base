In the meticulous world of actuarial science, where statistical rigor and business insight converge to assess risks and forecast financial outcomes, a quiet evolution is underway. This evolution is driven by the nuanced capabilities of generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI), a branch of AI that has gradually gained recognition within the industry.

## What is generative artificial intelligence?

Gen AI is the emerging field of AI and was popularized in 2022 by OpenAI ChatGPT, a Gen AI chatbot based on Generative Pre-training Transformer architecture. It

encompasses algorithms that can produce new content, whether it's text, visuals, audio or even computer code. Gen Al includes a variety of methods, such as sophisticated text generators, deepfake technology and systems that convert text descriptions into images.

Among the various generative technologies, the key advancement pertains to the ability of machine-learning models to generate responses in natural language that closely resemble those produced by humans, often making them nearly indistinguishable.

For actuaries who grapple with vast amounts of unstructured data, Gen Al offers a promising avenue to transform data into actionable insights, enhancing the precision and efficiency of their work.

## Page 4
While generative Al encompasses a broad range of techniques and applications, large language models (LLMs) represent a significant breakthrough in the field.

# What is a large language model? 

LLMs are central to Gen AI. These models are part of two primary types of Gen AI/generative adversarial networks, which excel in creating images, texts and translations, and LLMs themselves. LLMs are specifically designed to understand the statistical relationships between words and phrases, enabling them to produce text that is both coherent and grammatically correct.

These models are trained on vast datasets, which makes them highly proficient in mimicking human communication. This capability provides actuaries and other professionals with powerful tools to efficiently manage and analyze complex data.

A critical aspect of how these models work involves tokenization, a process vital to text analysis and machine learning. Tokenization breaks down unstructured text data into

smaller units, or tokens, assigning each a numerical index, which simplifies the way models understand and process language.

# Navigating the divide: traditional machine learning vs. Gen AI 

The AI landscape is characterized by traditional machine learning, with its discriminative models for classifying and predicting outcomes, and Gen Al, which fosters innovation by creating entirely new data. The distinction between the discriminative and generative models is vital. Discriminative models excel in classification and prediction tasks, making them suitable for analytical applications. In contrast, generative models are unparalleled in their ability to create and innovate, making them ideal for tasks requiring new content generation.
